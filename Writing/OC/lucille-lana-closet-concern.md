Lucille looks into her lover's eyes with an unsure and very concerned expression as she listens intently. She's on edge until Lana leans forward and grabs her hands and promises to let her know if she feels anything weird. 

"Okay, I'm going to get a bag of frozen peas, and your bag. I'll be right back, okay? "

She looks around for something soft for Lana to rest on and sees a pillow above them on a shelf. She reaches up for it and places it gently behind Lana's head before kissing her lightly on the forehead and making her way out of the closet and to the fridge. The chaos of the fight seems to have settled down. She immediatelly retrieves the peas and returns to the closet without wasting time. 

When she returns Lana is looking up at her with a dizzy look on her face, but she also has a small smile, which puts Lucille at ease.
