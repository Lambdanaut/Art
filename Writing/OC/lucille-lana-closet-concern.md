Lucille looks into Lana's eyes with an unsure and very concerned expression as she listens. She's on edge until Lana leans forward and grabs her hands and promises to let her know if she feels anything weird. 

"Okay.." She starts, "I'm going to get a bag of frozen peas.. and your bag too. What do you say we ditch this place? Would you like to go home? We can chill on your bed and get our heads straight... Think about it, and I'll be right back. "

She looks around for something soft for Lana to rest on and sees a pillow above them on a shelf. She reaches up for it and places it gently behind Lana's head before making her way out of the closet and to the fridge. The chaos of the fight seems to have settled down. She immediatelly retrieves the peas and Lana's bag, which is sitting on its side in the kitchen. 

When she returns, Lana is looking up at her with a dizzy look on her face, but she also has a small smile, which puts Lucille at ease.
