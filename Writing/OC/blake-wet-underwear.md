"YO BITCHES!"
*Blake kicks at the sliding patio door trying to kick it open but it's a sliding door so it just jostles and leaves a wet footprint.*
"Oh shit"
*Blake slides the sliding glass door open and tries again*
"YO BITCHES!"
"BURGE-" he starts to yell. Then, he nearly drops his burgers as he stares in shock and awe at the room before him.  
"hhhhhhh?"
He didn't know how to quite process this scene.

"HHHHHHHHHH?"

*Blake wanders through the crowd and sees Chell*
