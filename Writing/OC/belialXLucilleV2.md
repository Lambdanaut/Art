There's an audible gasp from the crowd. 
It's Lucille's turn in the closet. 
It's Lucille's turn in the closet with.. *him*. 
Are they even a him? Like, what is this thing's pronoun? 
"Thing" Lucille thinks to herself. Maybe a little insensitive, but in this case, that's what you get. They're *not human*. 
*Belial rolls his chair slowly into the closet and Lucille follows behind trying to maintain composure.*
When they're in the dark, Lucille flips on the switch and there he is, staring right into her eyes, as if he knew exactly where they'd be. 
Just *smiling*. 

f u c k .

Lucille starts: "Look. I fucking know who you are. I'm onto you. You might have D.D and the rich boy under your spell, but it's going to take more than that to - ", *Belial gently raises his arm up to Lucille as if to shake hands again, just like he did the first time they met.* 
*Lucille blinks in subtle unease and horror and stares for a second before slapping his stub away.* 
"DON'T PLAY THAT SHIT WITH ME. DO *NOT* PLAY THAT SHIT WITH ME. I know who you are friend. I read them. I read them all. As you were waltzing about in your chair pretending to not have a care in the world, your little boyfriend was revealing all of your dark secrets."
"EXHIBIT ONE." *Lucille pulls out her phone which shows a screencapture from one of D.D's snapchats. D.D is smilling widly into the camera with Belial in the background hunched over his laptop. A heart-shaped box of chocolates covered in stickers sits on the desk.*
"ENHANCE." *Lucille exclaims as she zooms in on the laptop with her fingers. Lucille reads out the tiny dialogue displayed on the monitor.*
```"...Lucille doesn't really give a shit about Valentine's Day. The morning of Valentine's Day she hears something on the radio about it and then freaks out because she realizes that Valentine's Day probably means a lot to Lana. She anxiously looks around her room and starts digging through her stuff. Soldering iron?" "no." throws it over her shoulder. "vial of toad venom?" "guh noooo" throws it over her shoulder..."```
"This was shared Valentine's Day morning.", Lucille pauses as her eyes open wide "THAT. MORNING."
*Lucille sees a flashlight on the shelf, grabs it and directs its beam into Belial's face.*
"HOW THE FUCK DID YOU KNOW THAT SHIT?"
"There's a document about me *losing my virginity*."
"Were you there? Did you see it?" *Lucille waits a second for an answer which doesn't come.*
"There were detailed character sheets. There were moments where I felt like you were *detailing my thoughts*."
*Lucille's left hand is pressing against her forehead in anguish.*
"I haven't even seen most of it either because the snapchats are usually blury or obscured. I can't imagine what else is in there."
"But I did see a panel about Yvonne and Niko. I saw you writing about Yvonne and Niko, together, at homecoming."
"That didn't happen."
"So I thought: what is this to you?", "are we some sort of documentary/fanfiction?", "how much of it is even true?".
"That's when I realized who you are. 
My brother read me a lot of esoteric stuff growing up. Lots of Tibetan philosophy. This idea of a 'traveler' came up a few times. Someone so detached from the fabric of their continuum that they retain memories of alternate realities, and can even move between them at will. That's why you mentioned Yvonne and Niko. Because YOU WERE THERE. "
*Belial's eyes unchangingly gaze into Lucille's*
*Lucille gets right up to his face and shines the light directly into his eyes* 
"TELL ME THE TRUTH. YOU'RE A TRAVELER, AREN'T YOU?"
"ARE YOU EVEN A HUMAN?"
"STOP WATCHING US HAVE SEX YOU FUCKHEAD."
*just then the door to the closet that Lucille is leaning against opens and Lucille falls out.*
"THAT WAS ONLY 6 MINUTES. I'M NOT DONE." she says. 
"Dude it was 7 get outta there.", Blake responds. 
*Lucille looks around for Lana and walks over to her*
"I'm fine. Just..."
"I'll be fine."
