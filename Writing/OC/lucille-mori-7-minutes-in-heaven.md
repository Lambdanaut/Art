Lucille: Mori... probably one of those awkward situations where they're both sitting in there quietly thinking of something to say. Lucille Starts to speak but then Mori does too and they both stutter and are like "you were gonna say..?" "Oh sorry, you first" "Erm, err". And then Lucille would say "I really like your dresses." At which point Mori's eye would open wide and she'd blush and after like 7 seconds she'd say "thank you"
