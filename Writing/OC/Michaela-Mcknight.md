Okay I did an OC (with Rat's help :) )
It's Niko's ex from c y b e r s p a c e

Her name is Olive Mcknight. She's a 5'9'', 

She's a cute, shy, nerdy girl in high school living in Tijuana, Mexico. She has a crappy home life, and pretty much no friends at school, but when she discovered Niko's stream, she fell head over heals. He was nice to her, for some reason. And she loved the games and anime he streamed, unlike any of the kids at her school. In her eyes he was the coolest. 
Niko always sorta thought of her as "that stream girl that's obsessed with me" so he sort of unconsciously used her as an ego boost rather than actually being in love, and so it wasn't hard for him to fall into a relationship with her. 

Getting in a relationship really only served to boost her infatuation, which fed into Niko's ego. 

After a few months of being together, she flies out to California to meet Niko a couple times, and they have a good time, though they never actually kiss. They go to an amusement park. Ride the rides. Eat foods and stuff. It's weird, but Niko isn't actually very anxious around her. Like somehow he's just not attached to her like he should be? But she is. She's very attached. 

The break up is hard.

They'd get in fights, repeatedly. Olive would ask him if they could talk one-on-one more, but he seemed to spend most of his free time streaming or doing anything *But* talking directly with her. Sometimes the fights got nasty. When they'd end on a sour note, Niko would ban her from his streams, and ghost her for a few days. 

But she could still sign off and watch his streams. 

One particularly horrible day, she was feeling like the world's garbage heap. She got home. Her parents yelling at each other in Spanish in the kitchen. She rushes to her bedroom and puts her headphones on to block it out. She signs off, and goes to Niko's stream, hoping for respite. His stream loads, and she's able to relax ever so little. "Even though Niko won't talk to me, at least he's okay... and.. it looks like... he's having a lot of fun..." She'd have a few tears running down her face as she'd watch him have fun without her. There was a girl he was playing with. She recognized her voice as a frequenter of the stream. Olive really didn't like this girl. She didn't like that Niko gave her attention. She didn't like how Niko talked to her. 

She felt so vulnerable and powerless. 

Then the girl said something in response to Niko. "..but you've already seen my tits.", as she let out a giggle.

"What.. what is she talking about.. Niko?", Olive's thoughts stammer out. 

Niko was suddenly quiet for a few seconds, "Uh... No....."
The girl laughed again "Oh no? Left that big of an impression on you huh? "
Niko laughed nervously, "Am I going to have to ban you? "
The girl shrugged, "I dunno. Is that how you deal with your feelings? "
Niko responds, "Just play the game and stop being so cute."

Olive's heart shattered. 

"Qué.. es.. ésto" she says under her breath, her eyes filling up like saucers as she processes what she's hearing. 

Niko is.. cheating on her? 

She.. can't do this

She can't look at him right now

She closes the stream. She *blocks Niko*. She blocks him on everything. She shuts off her computer. She leaves social media. She doesn't come back. 

A week later Niko calls. He's worried about her. Olive's little sister picks up and chews him out, *hard*. 
"Oh, she doesn't want anything to do with your cheating gringo ass. "
"Cheating?" Niko responds. 
"Yeah. She's doing better already without you so you can just *andá a cagar*"
"W- What?" Niko stutters out after a long pause
Olive' sister hangs up.

Niko sits there, realizing what he's done. He feels like shit. He feels like he's been leading this girl on, and he's right. He feels like a liar. A shitty one. 

He realizes what Olive's sister was on about. He hadn't ever actually responded to the nudes. They made him.. *nervous*.. more than anything. He basically had ignored them.. but.. he had never told Olive about them.. and he really felt like shit because of that. 

Niko doesn't stream for a while after this. The girl that sent the nudes messages him after a couple of days to check on him, and he blocks her. 

After the breakup:

Olive takes it as a cue to invest heavily in herself. She hits the gym, but also learns guitar and goes all in with her singing career. She gets hot, and joins a band. Around age 19, her band `McKnight` lands a sick contract, and she tours America with another top band. They do really fucking well to the point that she becomes a minor celebrity.

By this point her personality has done a 180. She's fiery hot, with loads of confidence. Maybe superficially a bit of a bitch but inside is actually a nice person.
