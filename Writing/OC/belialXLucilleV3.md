This is getting chaotic. Was Chase okay? Suddenly Lucille was a little more nervous about this game. Something in her wanted to go make sure he's okay. They weren't the closest of friends, but seeing him like that made her stomach sink. The kids around were laughing, pointing out that he had his shirt off, and making implications, but his face told a different story.
Lucille opened her mouth to ask Lana if she wanted to head somewhere else for a bit, but before she was able to ask, there was a sudden audible gasp from the crowd. 
"Lucille!"
"Belial!"
It was Lucille's turn in the closet. 
It was Lucille's turn in the closet with.. *him*. 
Are they even a him? Like, what is this thing's pronoun? 
"Thing" Lucille thinks to herself. Maybe a little insensitive, but in this case, that's what you get. They're *not human*. 
*Belial rolls his chair slowly into the closet and Lucille follows behind trying to maintain composure.*
D.D watches wide eyed as they both enter. She looks like she's about to blow a fuse, but in a really good way. 
When they're in the dark, Lucille flips on the switch and there he is, staring right into her eyes, as if he knew exactly where they'd be. 
Just *smiling*.

Lucille starts: "Look. I fucking know who you are. I'm onto you. You might have D.D and the rich boy under your spell, but it's going to take more than that to - ", *Belial gently raises his arm up to Lucille as if to shake hands again, just like he did the first time they met.* 
*Lucille blinks in subtle unease and horror and stares for a second before slapping his stub away.* 
"DON'T PLAY THAT SHIT WITH ME. DO *NOT* PLAY THAT SHIT WITH ME. I know who you are buddy. That's right. I've seen your documents."
"While you were waltzing about in your chair pretending to not have a care in the world, your little partner was revealing all of your dark secrets." 
*Belial's face shows no reaction at all to this news.*
"I was at my girlfriend's place on Valentine's Day. We were hanging on her bed, and she got a snapchat from D.D.
It was a video of them, smiling widly into the camera, with *you* in the background, next to a heart-shaped, sticker-covered box of chocolates, hunched over your laptop in the school library. A completely innocuous scene at first glance, maybe even a little cute. That's probably why Lana felt the need to show it to me. She handed me her phone, then went off to take a shower. But as I sat there, watching the video, I noticed something on your monitor. Something that turned my blood cold. "
"You were scrolling slowly through a document. In that document there were paragraphs upon paragraphs of writing. Writing about *me*. Writing about *my friends*. Writing about things we've done and said that nobody should fucking know."
*Lucille sees a flashlight on the shelf, grabs it and directs its beam into Belial's face.*
"HOW THE FUCK DID YOU KNOW THAT SHIT?"
"There was a paragraph about me *losing my virginity*."
"Were you there? Did you see it?" *Lucille waits a second for an answer which doesn't come.*
"There were exhaustive character sheets. There were moments where I felt like you were *detailing my thoughts*."
*Lucille's left hand is pressing against her forehead in anguish.*
"I didn't even see most of it either because the video finished before you stopped scrolling. "
"But I did see a paragraph about Lana. I saw you writing about Lana winning homecoming queen.
"That didn't happen."
"It didn't happen... because I am a *fucking idiot* that voted for Chel instead."
"And you wrote that in. You knew who I voted for." *Lucille looks down for a moment as her vision fogs up from a forming tear. She takes a deep breath and looks back up*
"So I thought: what is this to you?", "are we some sort of documentary/fanfiction?", "is this *just* the result of a student with a sick obsession?".
"That's when I realized who you are. 
My brother read me a lot of esoteric stuff growing up. Lots of Tibetan philosophy. This idea of a 'traveler' came up a few times. Someone so detached from the fabric of their continuum that they retain memories of alternate realities, and can even move between them at will. That's why you wrote about Lana on stage, accepting her tiara. Because YOU WERE THERE."
*Belial's eyes unchangingly gaze into Lucille's*
*Lucille gets right up to his face and shines the light directly into his eyes* 
"TELL ME THE TRUTH. YOU'RE A TRAVELER, AREN'T YOU?"
"ARE YOU EVEN A HUMAN?"
"STOP WATCHING US HAVE SEX YOU FUCKHEAD."
*just then the door to the closet that Lucille is leaning against opens and Lucille falls out.*
"THAT WAS ONLY 6 MINUTES. I'M NOT DONE." she says. 
"Dude it was 7 get outta there.", Blake responds. 
*Lucille looks around for Lana and walks over to her with her head down*
"I'm fine. Just...
I'll be fine."
"..."
"I'm sorry..", she whispers.
