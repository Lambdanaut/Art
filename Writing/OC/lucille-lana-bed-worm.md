Lucille is flopped out on Lana's bed looking up at her ceiling. Her room is so much pinker than her own... 
She stretches her body out on the pink and white comforter and let's out a pleasurable little moan "i love your room so much :cry: "
"Really? but it's so different than your place. "
"That's why I love it so much. It's so much more comfortable. "
Lucille rolls herself up in the comforter. "and... I am a worm now :eyes: :worm: "
Lana giggles and says "and I'm a fish" jumping on her, nibbling her face
"GAAH FUUCK" Lucille yells, squirming about 
Lana wraps her arms around Lucille and kisses her cheek. "Don't worry, I won't eat you. You're way too sweet to be fish food.*
Lucille sticks her tongue out at Lana and Lana takes it as an opportunity to kiss
Lucille pulls her hands out of the blanket cocoon and wraps them around Lana "I have evolved hands"
Lana bites Lucille's nose gently "Oh? and what are you going to do with those hands" 
Lucille squeezes Lana's booty a little "What god made them for :eyes: "
