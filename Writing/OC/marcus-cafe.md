*In the original verse*:
After Lucille quits the caf√©, her brother Marcus takes over. Not willingly of course, but working as a barrista is no different in his mind from the usual mundanities he passes through at home on a day-to-day basis. His parents and sister request it of him, so here he is. "It's good to get out and have a purpose. It'll help.", they said.
It didn't help. 
But he wasn't holding out hope. He's here because *why not*.
And it's not like he was looking for hope. Why in God's name would he *want* to get better? The better things are, the more you have to lose. Sure, give him a smile. Give him love. Give him the crown of the kingdom. Give him all of these things and more so that he can know them, hide them in his heart, and have them wretched back out one-by-one forever. 
No. For real. Give him pain. Give him the misery. If it's what happens either way, he'll take it without the lie. Everything dies. Let's skip to the end. 
"I don't need the sugar and cream." he says to himself out loud in a daze. 
The customer responds "Err... excuse me?"
"I said that I'm getting the sugar and cream." he responds flatly as he turns his back to the bar and mixes the ingredients together."
*He takes a sip from his mug of water and lets out a long sigh.*
"Here you are ma'am. One de-caf espresso. *Extra* sweet.", he says with his eyes narrowed, trying not to think of the empty calories. The thought almost makes him gag. 
"What goes up must come down.", he rasps out under his breath.
"What's that sweety?"
"I said, enjoy your evening down town."
"Oh, thank you so much. You too!", the colorfully dressed moth woman gleefully exclaims. 
"Yeah, *me too*", he thinks to himself. 
He turns back to his sister's repaired computer she'd loaned to the cafe for accounting. He has a Microsoft Word doc open.
*Microsoft*. Once an empire. Now another dead dream. Long buried beneath these lone and level sands. *What goes up*. 
The document is titled `inauguration-acceptance-speech.docx`. 
He types the next line that he had been considering: "And no matter which pimple you're habitating on the godhead's perpetually pubescant scowl, we promise to be there to help clean up when it pops. No sick little monkeys, moths, frogs, humans, wolves, snakes, weasels, *you get the point* shall be left behind. Fuck divisivity. Fuck the hatred. We're coming together and I can't believe it but I believe in you. "
