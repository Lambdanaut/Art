Lucille doesn't really give a shit about Valentine's Day. The morning of Valentine's Day she hears something on the radio about it and then freaks out because she realizes that Valentine's Day probably means a lot to Lana.
*She anxiously looks around her room and starts digging through her stuff.* 
"Soldering iron?" "no." *throws it over her shoulder*
"vial of toad venom?" "guh noooo" *throws it over her shoulder.*
"software? i could write her software..." *looks over morosely at her computer*
"..." "fuck."
*Lucille is at a loss. She looks over at her plants and breathes in deeply. She prepares to face her worst fear: *floral arrangement.* 
*She pushes her monitor to the side to make room for flowers.*
*She picks one of every flower from the plants she has growing and lays them out on the table in front of her.*
It takes her 2 hours to figure out which flowers to put together in a bouquet that she thinks looks good(probably?), but she finally manages it. She holds it up in the light: a really beautiful arrangement with prominent purple and teal highlights. 
Unfortunately she's now late for the bus and has to ride her bike to school in the rain. 
As she's riding, her bike tires skid in a puddle and she falls off, hitting her elbow on the sidewalk. She rolls off and feels like crying but realizes she needs to get to school as soon as possible so she doesn't miss Lana before first period, so she hops back on her bike. 
When she arrives at school, she's drenched and her jeans are stained with lines of mud. Her elbow is still bleeding a bit. 
She starts heading to their normal morning meeting spot in the cafeteria. When she sees Lana, she takes a deep breath and reaches in her bag for the gift. 
But her hands grasp the broken remains of the bouquet that had snapped in two when she fell off her bike. 
Immediatelly she breaks down and starts crying in the middle of the cafeteria, feet away from Lana. 
"Fuck", "Why am I this way" "I'm so sorry Lana... I tried to make this for you" *Lucille tries to explain herself through the tears* "But it's destroyed" "I don't know what to do" *Her tears fall from her cheeks onto the broken bouquet*
