~Rewind a bit~

Blake sees Lana kiss Lucille after his kiss, and while he's not *exactly* jealous, he does feel like he got totally jipped. I mean his kiss was hot af, maybe more than he even wanted, but... the look in Lucille's eyes when she kissed Lana. That's like, love, right? That's real. He could go for some of that. Love. 

He leans back with a small grin as he watches them kiss, and hums a little tune to himself. 

~Skip back to now~

Blake is drunk okay. Blake is drunk and he's a little too drunk to realize it. But that's okay. Blake is having a great time. He's buzzed, he's high, *and* he's a dancing queen. Also he got his mind blown into kissing oblivion by his best friend. 

"Wow what a great party.", he thinks to himself. 

He looks around and notices something odd though: people are getting up and leaving! In droves too. Like, I think we just lost TWO young lovers at once? And now Chell is gone too? "Okay okay okay. I know what they need," Blake thinks to himself. "Incentive."

Blake gets up and announces, "OKAY, we've officially reached **LEVEL 2**. From here on out, if you're chosen together you get to go into the closet for *7 minutes* together. It's called *7 Minutes In Heaven* and you're gonna love it. "
