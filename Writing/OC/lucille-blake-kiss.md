*Blake spins the bottle and it lands on Lucille.* "Oh gross!" he exclaims jokingly. *He gets up to kiss one of his best friends as Lucille rolls her eyes smugly at him.* When their lips meet, Lucille grabs him by his stupid peach tank top and pulls him on top of her. His eyes open wide in shock as he tumbles over her and he has to throw his elbows down on the wood-paneled floor to stop from clobbering her. Suddenly they both find themselves in a more-intense-than-expected makeout session. Saliva is exchanged for a few seconds as Lucille moves her hands up Blake's chest to his neck where she grasps firmly for a few moments, then she moves her hands back to his chest and pushes him off.* She gazes up into his eyes with a tiny smirk "Gross, huh?". 
Blake blinks with a slight blush across his nose. "You're fucking dangerous Lucille. I mean I'm not complaining! but you're a little atom bomb."
"Atom bomb. I like that -w-"
