Bristol leaned against the hollow stump and wept. Every frame she was experiencing slowly became more and more prevalent, vivid, and meaningful, entirely because the pain was gone and the unfiltered layers of reality were creeping in. In this case, the meaning's actual lack of meaning was a dominating feature in her mind, which was troublesome.Troublesome in an "oh this FEELS" sort of way, not in a "Ouch this HURTS" sort of way, which was rare and almost new for her, but it was something she over time began to accept as a new feature of existence, and she could survive with it. Despite the long echoing decay that permeated herself for so long, she was visibly solid and existing, and was surprised to see this. She wasn't hollow and everything could be okay, given more frames. Bristol walked home, tripped a few times, scraped her knee, and ate dinner with her family in their cottage by the lake. The soup was a taste she savored every frame of. In the future she'd revisit the stump and take a long, long nap by it under the moon.
