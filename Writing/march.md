This morning I woke up feeling good, as far as I can feel good with this feeling of great... loss? It's not loss, it's just different. And besides, I can still talk to you here. 

On a car ride "Time of Our Lives" came on the radio and I immediatelly thought "oh fuck. here we go. every song is going to remind me of her now, isn't it?". Fortunatelly I wasn't right because "Rolling in the Deep" came on next, and I nunchucked to it for a while once I got home. 

As the day draws on I find that the most frustrating thing is not being able to hear how you're feeling right now, and not being able to let you know that I care about you. I hope that your writing is going well.

I'm fine. Out of the corner of my eye I saw Cat editing a doc and chatting with you. I dunno. It's just a *little* hard not being able to talk when Cat is. And can I just be blatant about something? This situation is inordinately fucked up for me because of my gender and how Dylan feels about that specifically. But whatever. I'm not upset about that. It's his thing. It's you guy's thing. I can separate myself well enough from it. 

I've had your house tours open in my browser but hadn't watched them yet. Time to go do that. I'm looking forward to hearing your dorky voice. 

Notes while watching:
* I love the little PVC hanger the cats are sitting in. 
* Lots of essential oils on the desk. Rosemary and Lavender definitely in there.
* I wonder how you feed your snakes. Once a week? All together? 
* Octopus shower curtain !!
* I saw that you have a Latin book. Can you tell me about that? When did you take Latin? 
* Toilet paper weapons! 
 * I used to collect toilet paper tubes to make model rockets. 
* A CAT WHEEL. WHAT !? <3o<3
* Seeing you at the end was aaaaaaaaaaaa nice

Also I had the thought of discussing gamedev with Dylan. Ludum Dare is in April, and game mechanics aren't my strong point. I'd also like to ask him if he has any ideas for potential game mechanics for my current game that is on hiatus. (Overworld)

I just learned from Kaylyn that you aren't reading the server. I was sad to hear that because I'd been weaving in content from our discussions/experiences into my RPs. You're *Really* in the dark, aren't you? 

I love you.

This is at least as hard as going without food or liquids, and I've done that for 3 days. By day seven do I die of de-Katie-dration? God I hope so. 

I had a dream last night. I was skirting the boundaries of a pond in a swamp. The water was full of aligators. When I'd nearly made it around I slipped and fell into the water, and an aligator started swimming for me. I thrashed wildly but then gave in and waited to be consumed. Right as the alligator reached me, it swam underwater and left me there without attacking. I swam to shore and continued on to the other side. 

Then I woke up and Dylan let me know that the word "God" is offensive to him. 

I realized last night that the only thing that I can hope to give Dylan right now is respect for his relationship with you. For him, that would mean offering to leave entirely if he asked. So I've made it clear that I am willing to do that if asked.

I almost forgot today's entry because we're actually kinda communicating now. 

I wrote a song. 


Random Notes

```
I was considering something important. 

I am a catalyst for allowing your unconscious to play in a potentially safe environment. 

You fear it putting others in uncomfortable situations - in which they won't tell you the truth about how they feel. 

Because I am honest with you, your unconscious won't be able to manipulate me beyond pre-determined rules, and I won't put myself(ourself) at jeapardy for the sake of pushing further. This puts your conscious mind at ease enough to allow the unconscious out a bit. 

You need someone that will be honest with you. It sounds like Jon is one of those people. 

Though I don't believe I'll hurt you. 

The only way I may hurt you is by being a catalyst for you, however it'll really only be yourself hurting you if that happens, and I'm never going to push anything on you. You'll take the steps. 
```
