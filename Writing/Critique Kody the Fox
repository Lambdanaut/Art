If you don't mind an honest critique, it seems to me like all of your characters are almost exactly alike in every conceivable way except for geographical location and species. 

Just to put it into perspective

[b]Weight:[/b] Always the same
[b]Body shape:[/b] Always the same
[b]Text description:[/b] Always the same with minor changes, such as their geographical location. 
[b]Interests:[/b] So many of them are interested in scuba diving it's freaking horrifying. I mean what the hell man. Some of your characters live in the American midwest or deep south where there are no opportunities for scuba diving whatsoever, and yet they're fucking scuba divers. WHAT THE HELL MAN. 
[b]Facial Expression:[/b] Always the same

I could go on and on about how exactly alike they all are, but it's giving me the creeps just thinking about it. No, really. You're a scary ass fellow. You scare the fuck out of me. You really just sit there at home, every day, re-making the same character over and over again in slightly different geographical locations. Do you even exist? Aren't you just a figment of the universe's imagination? Where is the fulfillment in doing this repetitive task? 

Basically, what's it like to be completely and utterly insane? 

and to answer your inevitably ensuing question, my favorite part of Casey the Hawk's scuba gear, is that it's located in Tennessee, a state with no significant sources of above-ground water other than minor lakes and the occasional wide river, all places that are not particularly suited for scuba diving in any way. I enjoy the situational irony employed here.
