i've never ever known a thing

that could be thought to be a thing

and so i'll never know the thing

that gives us right to be a thing



i like to think of words and things

i like the things words like these brings

and so i listen to your things

and these things bring me likened wings



these wings fly high into the night

you see them in your moon-lit sight

a mind imploded, out of room

our coffin vacant, an empty tomb



A resurrected life-long christ

we flight up til the highest heights

a ready willingness for change

to leave our life-long earth-bound range



We do not lie, we fear the dark

and in it lies the darkest stark

but in each other, we see a light

that shows the stark is scared in fright



It sees us; smells us; runs in fear

It screams and cries "a light is near"

The stark it cries it's melody

In your arms, I'm starkly free
