Nobody loved Billy, not even his narrator, who decided to name him "Billy", which is really just an onomastic stand-in for the variable "B" in this exposition of the end of his life. Dude was a basic bitch. Probably wore 80s band t-shirts he got at Walmart just so he could have any sort of social creed to stand by so that other people would leave him alone. But god forbid someone actually try to relate with him regarding the subject of the t-shirts. He can't name a song by Nirvana.

Anna, his only friend, who only spent any time whatsoever with him because of her own personal insecurity of being left completely alone in the world due to social discrimination against her equally generic-variable name(She's "A"!), was walking home with Billy after school. She was trying to figure out the best way to tell a joke she had thought up earlier that day while not paying attention in class.

At this point, I know what's about to happen to Billy, and even worse I'm starting to get a little heart-felt for Billy. I don't want to kill him like I'm about to. Maybe that makes this better. Maybe I should suffer too. Yeah.

Okay, look, Billy has freckles okay. Really cute ones. Little dimples too. Red hair. God he's just the cutest little Irish kid and he's almost androgynous in how representative he is for every human being. The kid is only 13 years old oh my god can you BLAME him for not knowing Nirvana? Maybe this rock-band shirt thing is just him trying to find himself. Maybe he'll grow up to be a classic-rock tribute musician.

But he won't, because he's about to die.

Good, now I'm hurting too. That's better.

OH RIGHT, THAT'S WHY I REDUCE PEOPLE TO VARIABLES, BECAUSE VARIABLES CAN'T HURT ME. THEY DON'T EXIST. THEY'LL NEVER LEAVE ME.

FUCK.

Now I'm really hurting ARE YOU HAVING A GOOD TIME READER.

Anyways. Billy, who was born in Tuscon, Arizona, a place I know nothing about.... OH GOD NO I CAN'T DO THAT, HE WAS BORN IN SUNNY JACKSONVILLE FLORIDA, AND LIVED NEXT DOOR TO ME. HE WAS MY BEST FRIEND. Ouch

Back to Billy. When he was younger, before the Terrible Thing ripped apart his family, and his dad left, he smiled a lot more. I like to think that's why he has the dimples now. All of that smiling. Do dimples come from smiling a lot? His did. His god-damn as sure well did.

So as I was saying, Billy Van-Phoenix Neo, who is becoming more and more important to me by the minute, was walking home with his best and only friend in this cold cold cold cold fucking everybody-leaves-you-in-the-end world, when she turned to him with a grin on her cute lil face. Innocence shining in her eyes. A warrant for expectation transcribed on her lips.

She'd figured out how to tell her joke.

"OKAY, BILLY"

"...???", Billy emoted cautiously at her sudden outburst that jutted out of their otherwise speechless journey.

"Billy... WhHAT DOES A SEXUALLY SUBMISSIVE YET INSISTENT FRENCH BRAIN SURGEON SAY SHE'LL BE FOR HER PARTNER?"

Billy paused and thought. "Ummm.... I'm not sure Anna... What..? ". He smiled. He was happy she was in such a good mood, and was excited for the punchline to such a convoluted joke.

"...LE BOTTOM; ME."!

Billy thought for a second and then cocked his head to the side. He didn't get it at first. He mulled over the joke for a moment, but then, slowly but surely, began to connect the dots.

Anna concernedly observed Billy’s unchanging expression. Was the joke too forced? She didn’t want to come off like she was trying too hard. Was she trying too hard?

But then it started. As a feeling low in Billy’s gut. Deep, below his muladhara. A feeling of depth and still continuity. It rose up rhythmically along his spine, and struck each center of energy throughout his body, blowing them utterly open.

He suddenly stopped walking alongside Anna, and looked around.

And from out of nowhere, the feeling of inner blows came. Pounding up from below. From his taint to the crown of his head. Powerful cyclical energy, forcing through his body in the pattern of a sine-wave over time.

As it rose through the center of his body, it pulled his lungs upwards with transcendent force, and a bellowing cough of a laugh blew from his lips, squeezing his dimples inward.

Unable to stop the process already started and knowing what is to come, I once again shut myself off to any feeling of Billy's humanity in a self-protective effort. Henceforth I will make no further references to Billy's adorable dimples. I'm such a little bitch. Billy forgive me.

As the energy reached the top of his head, it stopped, and began it's cyclical journey back down to his feet, pulling the laughter with it. The upwards and downwards motion of the sine-wave gave way to the HEE - UCK HEE - UCK HEE - UCK that is heard during powerful laughing storms.

And it was Billy's fate at this time to follow a very specific and directed pathway through the causal manifold. Because this joke, for Billy at this time in his life, was the ULTIMATE joke.

We each have our own ultimate joke. They exist in the nether, waiting to be accidentally conjured up by the pitiable mind. They are functions of the time and space that we live in, and change moment by moment. Even in the wizarding world, populated by those who are able to conjure up such "magical" words from the nether at will, there are laws that forbid the conjuring up of an individual's Ultimate Joke. For being possessed at any moment by one's Ultimate Joke is easily a fate far, far worse than death. Look man, death isn't even that bad, at all. The Dead find it really amusing that you're all so up-in-arms about death. However even the dead fear the knowledge of their own Ultimate Joke.

But that's a digression, because once again, I'm really trying to avoid facing what's about to happen to Billy.

As the sine-wave of laughter took hold in his body, it stole his focus. Demanded his focus. It acted as somewhat of a dark God, or maybe gravity itself. For a moment, the joke and the laughter were all that existed for Billy. It pushed upwards and then downwards with such force that he became disoriented and started to lose any notion for whether the energy was now going up or down through him. In fact he lost his ability to tell up from down entirely. And when he opened his eyes wide, pleading for repose, his universe had become nameless and without form. Was trippy as hell.

As the laughter demanded his focus, it precluded all else from his mind but the pure loop of the laughter itself. Billy forgot the punchline. He even forgot the JOKE. There was JUST laughter. Laughter entirely devoid of any joy or reason whatsoever.

As I mentioned, it was Billy's fate today to take a very unique pathway through the causal manifold. Billy, at the very least, would not actually physically die today. In every other way he would die, but not physically. Billy's body would go on for a while longer.

Every moment you are alive there is a non-zero chance of you dying. And every moment you live, the chance of the fulfillment of that promise of death inches upwards ever so slightly. The chance of death is never zero, and it is never 100%.

But because of the cosmic sine-laughter now pulsating through Billy’s body, Billy would not die. But he would also never truly live. Every moment, Billy's consciousness would be pushed by the cycle into continuity of the laugh pattern. Any possibility that is not "laughter" would be excluded from each and every moment that Billy would live, for ever.

The closest approximation in contemporary physics of Billy's new state is a time crystal. An adult Anna would one day begin an explanation of time crystals in a conference with her colleagues as so:

"Normal three-dimensional crystals, like diamonds, have a repeating pattern in space but remain unchanged with respect to time; time crystals on the other hand repeat themselves in time and space leading the crystal to change from moment to moment. "

All that now changes for Billy is the slow decay of his physical body. Decades later, Billy's husk of a corpse laughs off into infinity.

Anna doesn't tell jokes anymore. Anna doesn't smile anymore. Anna studies, and hopes that one day she will be able to fix what she broke.

Some say that on quiet nights, while watching a particularly funny episode of Seinfeld, one can still hear Billy's far off laughter. Having now lost his corporeal body entirely, he has become the laugh track.

I need a beer.
