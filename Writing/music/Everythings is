CAPO on 1st fret


C G x2

                    C
Everythings made of leather

                  G
Everything is the skin of what's alive

                    C
Everythings made of heather

                G
A flower that's waiting to arrive

                C                 F              G              Em    
Everything is a heartbreak with a milkshake in a diner that's a bar

                C                D         G
Everything is a mammoth drowning slowly in tar


          C             G          D                    Em
I wake up once again at two AM and burn through all the pages

     C                 G            D              Em
of a book written by a God some ten thousand years ago

   C                    G                D                Em
He promises me immortal life and all the knowledge of his sages

    C                D            G
But I'm just here to put you on a show



(They say that...)

C             G             D             Em
Everything is styrofoam and everything is plastic

    C             G                     D              Em
But everythings a thing that transcends all that I can say

    C             G                   D             Em
And everythings a real cool dude that I really look up to

    C             D              G
And everything is proud of you today



C G x2

                C
Everything is a muscle

                  G
Everythings gotta pull and then contract

                C
Everything is a hustle

                      G
Cuz everyone wants to be the best at track  


                C          F          G          Em
Everything is a cycle on a cycle in a cycle of a blur

                C              D            G
Everything is a theorem of the systems that were


          C             G              D               Em
And we go spinning on together in this spinning spinny world

              C              G             D                  Em
And though we cannot see the ending or the start or what's in store

          C                  G               D               Em
We both release with all our hearts and open all our boarded doors

        C                  D            G
I can't wait to look at my eyes through yours


C             G             D             Em
Everythings a xylophone and everyone's in traffic

  C              G                    D             Em
A song along our spines will melt the pain and fear away

  C                G                       D                 Em
A peace sign for a flipped bird; take your hearts out of the attic

        C              D              G
Hand in hand we beckon for a brighter day
