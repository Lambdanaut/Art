CAPO on fret 3

Graphs


And polynomials


Graphs *And* polynomials


Graphs, polynomials, and stars


Yeah stars


Graphs, polynomials, stars, and a cheeseburger


I can't eat gluten


Well we'll get you a lettuce wrap


Mmmmmm


And then we can do the rest of it


The rest of it?


Martians, spies, planes, and stars


Stars...


Stars.


And then? 


And then... 


Yes?


There's going to be a lot of hardship and pain. 


Ouch


Yeah, but that's what makes the story worth telling


But the stars


The stars are always up there, waiting for us


To look up


To look up. 


I see


And then what about you


and me?


Well yeah you, and you


And you and me


Well we have graphs and polynomials for that


And stars


Yes, and stars


I can show you here


And I can show you there


And somewhere in the middle maybe we'll find dear


Dear?


That's where. 


That's here. 


I think I can hear it


Can you hear it?


I can hear it here


That's my heart Joshua


Oh


Oh?


It sounds like something


Graphs, polynomials, and stars?


No, a cheeseburger. 


That makes sense


Does it?


We've spent so much time


We have spent a long time


And we tried everything *but* a cheeseburger


I'm not surprised either


I'm surprised at how surprised I'm not


At least we know now


What a cruel joke


and a funny one


Thank god we were so distracted the entire time


With each other?


With the graphs, polynomials, and stars


Yes those too


To ever notice that love wasn't any of those things


It was a cheeseburger?


Yes, and it was a lettuce wrap


Don't you think that's a little contrived?


Well, how would we measure that?


We'd need a graph


And some polynomials


And after we're done we could look at the stars
