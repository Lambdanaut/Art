No CAPO 


C G F C   x2


C                                 G
  I worry sometimes I'll get just what I wanted

      F                         C
  And I'll be left alone all my life


C                      G      
  I'll be a ghost of a past I never haunted

  F                                   C
  Regrets of never caring, weilding a scalpel as a knife


C G F C   x2


C                               G
  And when you're long gone and I'm all alone here

       F                        C       
  I'll finally hear a song that shows me how to care

	
C                               G
  After I've lost all that I've loved and wanted

  F                             C
  This fucking tune will rip me up and leave me bare


** CHORUS **


      G F    C
  And I am a hole, filled with all of our memories

  G     F      C
  And I am not whole, filled with nothing but misery

  G        F                   C
  And this pit that I tried to push you inside

           G   F  C
  is gonna eat me alive

  G    F                   C
  this pit that I tried to push you inside

           G   F  C
  is gonna eat me alive


C G F C   x2
  

C                    G
  Caring for you without really caring

          F                           C
  I was a slave in my mind and it was fear


C                         G
  That held me dearly and kept me from staring

           F                        C             
  Down the truth that my deeds were all held so dear


C G F C   x2


C                    G
  Burning rubble, is all that I am now

  F                            C
  Proud as hell of what I've become 
  
C                   G
  Scum is beautiful because it all rises

          F                              C
  There's truth to the saying that we're more than the sum

 

      G F    C
  And I am a hole
