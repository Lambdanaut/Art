CAPO 4

Em                   C
You took yourself on your own first date 

G
Your own first date

D
Your own first daaate




Em          C               G      D
Hey Grandma I picked up the phone

Em          C        G      D
Hey Grandma I am not alone

En          C                  G      D 
I know last summer things were weird

Em        C            G      D
I'm sorry that I disappeared


Em           C                 G        D
That sweater that you knit for me years ago

Em             C         G    D
I carried with me in the snow

Em            C               G  D
That's when I had no place to go

Em          C             G    D
I felt like one big messy show



I don't know what I've got but I know what I'll get


Spending all this money in my pocket on this damn cigerratte
