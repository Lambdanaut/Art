Spirit Pig

A E G D

A         E
Oh here I am again

G              D
Singing by the rivers sand

A          E
Hoping the spirits

     G                   D
Will hear me and they'll plea

A         E    
For me to save them

G                D
So that they can save me

A             E               G                D
You've got to give one out to get one back you see


A E G D


A      E                  G                  D
Now my pits are sweating, stomachs gritting, quite upsetting

A          E                 G                 D
Despite my know-how that the world will get on fine

A        E                   G              D  
My confidence is letting all that's left is morbid betting

A             E                      G                   D
I doubt we'll make it through and my doubts are well-fed swine




A         E              G                   D
Oink oink oink oink oink oink oink oink oink oink oink oink oink

A         E              G               D
Oink oink oink oink they squeel and squeel and whine


A         E            G                    D
Oink oink oink oink my doubts are screaming and they're squelching

A         E            G               D
Oink oink oink oink my slop-fed credit-line


A E G D


A           E
And from my other face

G        D
I hear a quite trace

A      E              G                D            
of the spirits that I wished to go and free


A                  E
They've begged for many years

G           D
And shed so many tears

A         E                 G               D
For me to let them come and take and pay my fee


A             E
But my fee is coverin

G          D
My skin so sufferin

A         E              G        D
How can I submit them to all this misery


A             E    
Oink is their sole reply

G               D
and I feel like I could die

A              E                G                D
Those pigs and spirits were the same thing livin me
