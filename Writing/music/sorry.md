CAPO 2
G Em C D


    G
I'm sorry that I hide. I'm sorry that I'm scared
    Em                    C        D
I'm sorry that I won't be here for you
    G                         
I'm sorry that I ran, and called you all those names
     C                          D       G
I'll always be the thing that's hurting you

    G
I'm sorry for the times, I lied behind your back
  Em                        C      D
I kept my lies hidden in my poison knapsack
  G
I drank from it daily, and gave some to you
   C               D           G
We drank until our lips turned blue

  G
I thought I couldn't trust you, cuz you couldn't trust me more
  Em                         C               D
I fucked my insecurities and left you at the door
  G
I screamed profanities, I called you a whore
  C                     D            G
I called you a whore. I called you a whore.

  G
I pretended like I'm perfect 'til I really thought I was
  Em                                    C                D
I pretended like you're worthless cuz I really thought I was
  G 
I pretended like I'm crazy, and that's how I got somewhere
    C                               D           G
I'm sorry that I hurt and you and I didn't even care

    G
I'm sorry that I'm sorry and I'm sorry for this song
        Em                         C        D
and I'm sorry that I told you that you were wrong
    G
I'm sorry that I let you know I cared
    C                      D         G
I'm sorry that I lied, and lied, and lied

    G
I'm sorry that I lie all day in bed
    Em                       D      G
I'm sorry that I wish that I were dead






((This last bit needs to be worked on and added in somewhere as a chorus))

G                      Bm                C
Chancellor Chancellor, Can't you hear my call?
G                    Bm                D              C
I'm screaming in the darkness, and I'm praying for my fall. 
G                       Bm                D             C                
Your hangman's noose is coming and you're watching from afar
