  This is a terrible song

D                                      C       G D
I wrote the lyrics, purposefully to be wrong

C           G 
  This is a shit show hell

D                                      C
And I'm ringing the shit show bell for you

         G                 D
(And the shit shows always free)

C                  G
Dance and sing and scream and squeel 

           D                                     C               G       D               
You're the pigs in the fire, and I can heal when I'm with you tonight


    C                               G
I'm dancing and I'm singing and I'm screaming out loud

  D
I don't know if I'll be heard throughout the town

      C
But I hope

  G                    D
I hope that they don't hear me


C         G           D
This song goes out to Charlie

        C                    G        D
Without Charlie, we wouldn't have our Harley 

           C          G           D
We'd still be, dustin around in a firepit

            C       G   D
In our back yard


C                                         G
Thank you thank you, thank you my friend. Thank you thank you till the very end

D                            C                     G
Thank you thank you till the star lights fall into me

C
Thank you, Charlie for busting our party

G
Thank you Charlie for your shit in our shoes

D                         C                  G
Thank you Charlie for the unwanted pressured booze

C           G

Thank you Charlie for your honest outrage

G
Thank you Charlie for your jealousy

D                         C               G
Thank you Charlie for the way you terrify me

C
Thank you Charlie for being a sinner

G
When I needed a frienemy

D                      C                      G
Thank you Charlie, for keeping your shit show free
