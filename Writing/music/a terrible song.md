C           G
  This is a terrible song

D                                      C       G D
I wrote the lyrics, purposefully to be wrong


C           G 
  This is a shit show hell

D                                      C
And I'm ringing the shit show bell for you

         G                 D
(And the shit shows always free)

C                  G
Dance and sing and scream and squeel 

           D                                     C               G       D               
You're the pigs in the fire, and I can heal when I'm with you tonight


    C                               G
I'm dancing and I'm singing and I'm screaming out loud

  D
I don't know if I'll be heard throughout the town

      C
But I hope

  G                    D
I hope that they don't hear me. 


     C              G             D               C               G          D
It's sad it takes a common frienemy, for us to be free, to be our own shittery
