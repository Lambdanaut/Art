Learning to Relax by Dan Deacon

A
I wanna take a ride
                   E
I like it when you drive with me
                    F#m
I've got nowhere to go or show you
                       D
Just take me out of my mind


                A
I wanna see the lights
                          E
Coming towards us with my glasses on
                          F#m
Full of thoughts drifting by in darkness
                    D
Just take me out of my my mind

    A
You arrived
A soft slow end of time
Sayin if all we saw were bright lights, darkness, is what we'd try to find

                  A
I wanna hear your voice
                           E
Like the trees behind this restaurant
                              F#m
You can see them through that roofless building
                         D
That once was somebodies home

                   A
I really like this photograph
                      E
When did you feel the pattern form
              F#m
It started to engulf in side me
              D
Even when I'm not alone

    A
You arrived
A soft slow end of time
Sayin if all we saw were bright lights, darkness, is what we'd try to find

Your eyes
Tell me I'm still alive
No matter what else happens, it's perfect, when you're right by my side
