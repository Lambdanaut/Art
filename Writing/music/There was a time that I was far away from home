There was a time that I was far away from home

So I cried and cried and cried, till I made a path home

And I ran till my knees were bleeding green

Cause the blood inside of me, wasn't me

And the voice that I spoke would only scream

Yelling "WHY DID YOU LEAVE ME"

Tell me when there was a time, where the heaven's only shine

Cause I'm breaking with no means

And I need to know the truth, cause my heart belongs to you

But your words don't seem to be

Tell me what I should do, when I'm breaking over for you

There was a time that I was far away from home

But only when you were away

Cause the only home I need was right with me

Self deprivation sure was mean

But I'm glad to be me
