CAPO 3


D C G


D
So tell me friend which one would you sell?

    C                            G
The good for me, the bad, or the downright hell?

D
If I could choose just one to be,

        C              G
I'td be this one, just this one


D
Dirty, scruffy, and crude as hell, 

C                         G
Cosmopolitan venture in a sinkhole well


D
I shine so brightly standing in Time's Square

       C                    G
Lights glistening off of my mud stained hair



D               
So tell me friend which one would you buy?

C           G
Me Oh Me Oh My My My

D
Lookit all those shiny things

C                     G             D
glistening behind the glass of evil kings



D
They've been livin' like a tick on the Earth

             C                                G
And when the tweezers come out, we'll see the bloodsack's girth


D
I've always wondered what a tick feels when it dies

      C                             G                   D 
As it squirms and it screams and it buys buys buys buys buys


D
Ripped out from our skin and crushed in the dirt

      C                        G
I can only really hope that it hurts like we hurt.


D
The last thing I think that it can behold

       C                          G
Is the smell of the Earth that it sold sold sold sold sold
