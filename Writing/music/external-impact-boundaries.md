I listen to this voice inside my head and it tells me what I should do and I do that un til I'm dead

    C7              C                 Am               Em                  F                  G7            C        C
I'm born and then I scream and then I learn and then I scheme and then I'm cut and that's the color we call red


    C7                C                  Am              Em                 F             G7             C        C
The red it pours like waterfalls as it's mopped up by microbe mothballs and spat out into dirt to grow a tree

    C7                  C                   Am         Em                   F                  G7             C       C
And from the tree there grows a fruit, soon eaten by a mothball brute, who dreams to be quite bigger than he be


   G         F           C            Am
To be honest I'm fucking sick of it 
        G                F             C     Am
I don't want anything to do with it at all
        G                 F           C               Am                   G              F             C       Am

I burn and then I scream and then I weep and then I break down and I hope to god it helps to get me there

   C7         C          Am            Em               F                G7                  C      C
To honesty, alevity, lobsterman by the raging sea, in a desert where the rocks rust from the air

	 C7                 C                Am                Em              F            G7              C       C
I'll hang out with your dark side as she tries to break my neck and I just chuckle as I kiss her on the chest. 

   C7           C             Am            Em         F                 G7            C       C
As far as I can see you see a raging sea of misery but god knows hell is better than a rest. 



   G         F           C            Am
To be honest I'm fucking sick of it

        G                F             C     Am
I don't want anything to do with it at all
