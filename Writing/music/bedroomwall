Em C G D with fingerpicking

CAPO 1


Darkness drawing near from that space behind my bedroom wall

I try to stand and run but I know that it's my time to fall

Burnt my hand in your hand with our plastic melting ethanol

Thought that we were real till a mirror showed me just a doll



E A G D with fingerpicking

E
Plastic boys who'd I'd like to meet

A
Plastic boys beggin at your feet

G                                D
Plastic boys suckin on your teet please notice me! 


E
Plastic boys every night and day

A

G                             D
