CAPO 1

Em C G D

I can get you out of all this shit but I can't guarantee you a kiss

So grab my hand and come with me

I'll sprout my wings (I've got fucking wings) and then we'll fly

And then we'll crash into a treeee

And die, we'll die, we'll die, we'll die, we'll fall right down that tree and die

We'll fucking die we'll fucking burn

Our wings will catch on fire and 

we'll burn, we'll burn, we'll burn

and then the smoke and fire rises up to the leaves

and that's how the whole tree caught on-fire

that's how the whole tree

started to burn it started to burn

and that's the story of how we lost the town

How we lost the town



Little Jimmy; Little Bob

You live in the mob's house

The Italian mobs house is where you live

Little Jimmy; Little Bob

Your parents, they're never home. 

They're never there for you. 

They're always out fucking dying and killing and moving booze

You're always breaking and crying and yellin out and screaming to

A song you'll never be able to sing to


ooooooooo


Little Jimmy; Little Bob

I can't believe in you

You don't have this, you can't

Make it through

You won't leave this house, this land

This burning town and sand

You'll go.. you'll go... to



Burning fire; Burning fire

It's sorta an oxymoron until you realize

It's even worse than that

It's just the shit that comes out of this mouth and throat

And throat

And throat

And that's all (gurgling noises)
