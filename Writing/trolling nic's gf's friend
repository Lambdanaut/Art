There's this spectrum of bad things that can happen to people. Some of these misfortunes are really funny. 
On one end there's slipping and falling on a banana, and on the other end there's being raped in a dungeon by 11 lab-monkeys for a mad scientist's amusement. 
Somewhere along the spectrum people draw this imaginary line where things suddenly drop off from being "omg so hilarious slapstick comedy" to "disgusting".  
Why? It's arbitrary. 
The line is placed at whatever the contemporary culture has decided they are going to collectively shit their pants over. 
Right now it's rape, because somewhere between 2007 and now women started blogging a lot, and they should really stop doing that, because they seem to think there's some sort of one-to-one correlation between "blogging" and "whining about everything". 

Here's the real kicker to my point. 
How many women bloggers do you know that decry rape? That make posts trying to convince people to not commit the act of rape? Yeah. Those don't really exist. See, that would be productive. That wouldn't be whining about the issue; that would be trying to fix the issue. That would be against their nature. 

Now how many women bloggers do you know that decry people telling jokes? 

The great evil of the 2000s is people telling offensive jokes. Man, when did the world get so boring?
