"Listen, Marvin, I've got like, seven guns, FULL of bullets, in my pants. That's a lot of those things! I'll blow ya away Marv. Now give us the girl! "
Marv stood there, staring the man directly in the cheek.
"..."
"Marvin I'm not fucking around. You have five seco-"
"BOSS I THINK THE MARVIN IS ACTUALLY A DOLL, SIR, MAN." piped up Randolph.
"..."
"...What now?" gaped Boss.
"AS IN, SIR, I, I DON'T BELIEVE YOU'RE INTERROGATIN AN ACTUAL LIVIN GUY."
"..."
Boss was upset.
"Randolph you dolt that's the STUPIDEST thing I've heard, maybe ever! "
But Boss was now more unnerved than upset.
Could it really be true that he'd been interrogatin a dummy of Marvin this entire time? That would mean the the actual Marvin had gotten away... with the girl... hours ago.
Hours? Really? Is that how long this interrogatin had been progressin? Had we really been here for HOURS?

Damn.
Damn.

Better check. Just to prove to Randy that he doesn't know a shit.
Boss leaned up close to "Marvin". Right up to his woody, polished face, the exact woody polished face that Boss had grown to hate so dearly over the past few hours.
Boss stared that splintery prick right in the eye.

..

Damn.
Damn.

..

"..."
"...Randolph, you don't know a shit! Go get me my err.. uh... Sandwich! We haven't eaten in hours and you can just tell Marvin is starvin. Look at those eyes, glassing over like that. He's finished if we just eat in front of him. He'll cave in mere bites! Nobody can resist my mother's handiwork. "
"YEP BOSS!" Randolph farted.
"Ugh, Randolph" thought Boss.

Randolph stumbled off to the back room. The second he was out of sight, Boss grabbed the now obvious doll of Marvin and ran into the hall, down the corridor and into the janitor closete where he hid it behind the janitor's gleaming, yellow mop set. It was a damn beautiful mop set, and sometimes Boss even missed his past as a janitor when he saw Rusty working that mop like he did.

Damn.
Damn.

Boss left the doll there and ran back to the interragatin room where he non-hesitantly whipped out one of the seven guns from his pants and shot an extremely loud shot at the door he had just come from.

"RANDY, RANDY GET YOUR ASS OUT HERE, HE'S A RUNNIN'" Boss squeeled!
"THERE HE GOES RANDY, HE'S MAKIN A RUN FOR THE ROAD
WHERE ARE YOU WHEN YOU'RE NEEDED RANDY
YOU SANDWICH FETCHIN' FOOL!"

But it was too late. By the time Randy re-appeared in the doorway holding one of the most delicious sandwiches ever proffered down from God's good grace, the bust of Marvin was gone.

Marvin had escaped

Hours ago.
