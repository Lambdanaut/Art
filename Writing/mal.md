Prior experience: Many lysergamides, phenethylamines, tryptamines, dissociatives, Salvia, and a single low-dose san pedro trip. 

On the way to a small free local festival I took a **15mg** dose of MAL which would be considered between a threshold and a light dose on psychonaut wiki. I wanted to start low as this was my first time with a mescaline analogue.

I drop the MAL and get in the car to drive the 35 minutes to the event

As I meet some chill folk and hang out with them at their tent, I begin to feel it. I have a small veggie taco and soon feel some light nausea that I have to breathe through. I get the "psychedelic yawns" that often accompany my tryptamine trips. Deep, relaxed breathing, and taking my time on the come-up without placing any expectations on my new friends or the event itself helps the come-up along smoothly.

Still have nausea, but it's very manageable. I'm surprised at how much nausea there actually is considering it's such a light dose. It's not anything I can't deal with, and I feel amazing. I just realize that I shouldn't be eating any more food, so I don't. There is mild euphoria as I stretch my body along the grass and breathe in the day.

Definitely tripping. It reminds me quite a lot of the single low dose San Pedro I had last year. Similar potency. Similar effects. Maybe the nausea was a little worse with this but again it didn't stop me from enjoying myself at all, and the breathwork eased it away almost entirely. 

The visuals are very much like mescaline for me, which means not too many visuals. It's like the world has a simple filter over it that highlights the beauty of nature. The trees and plants seem more alive, and almost look to be breathing. The sky and the air around me has a similar breathing effect.

I'm almost at the peak now. I help some newcomers set their tent up and they don't seem to have any idea that I'm tripping.

It's very reminiscent of a low-dose candyflip. I'm feeling very empathetic to these newcomers, and other guests I meet. Definitely feeling that serotonin rolling, and I want to connect with others and help people have beautiful experiences. I find some children's bubbles that had been left behind from a previous event and I run around the event grounds blowing bubbles for people and acting as a sort of clown/jester figure, bringing vibes up and creating a playful space for the guests. Everyone loves it, especially the children. 

7:00

I'm starting to come down, and I feel it in the conversations I'm having with the people around me. The roll that the MAL was feeding me is dying down and I find I'm having to put more of my own will and energy into conversations and people in order to maintain the same vibe. This is no problem for me, and I happily give myself to others as the MAL was teaching me to do. 

10:00 onwards

The afterglow is beautiful, but I'm finding myself tired, so looking after myself I decide to call it a night and drive home. I'm feeling nearly sober and I don't have any problem driving whatsoever. I sleep like a rock and wake up feeling wonderful. 


I really enjoyed MAL at this dose! It was all I was hoping for and a bit more. I'm interested to see it at a common dose sometime in the future.
