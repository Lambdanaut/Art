There's a banana to the left of my left hand. It's curled in a particular pattern that I placed it into because I didn't want it to get gross banana gunk all over my desk. I'm listening to They Might Be Giants in a tired, ornery funk, sort of just writhing these words out of my fingers, forcefully. I'd rather be dead. 

I didn't sleep well last night because Catherine stayed up all night. She crawled into bed next to me at 7:00, one hour before I'd get up for work. I'm iratekkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk ill me, please.
