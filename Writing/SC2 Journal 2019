# SC2 Journal 2019



## December


5th
---

* 3 Queen opener. Not 4 queen opener. 4 queens leave me with way too much larva and not enough minerals to use them for drones
* 4:30 spores ALWAYS vs ANY hellion opening! <3


4th
---

* Shift-click a unit on the map to add it to the current selected units. If we accidentally grab 2 workers to saturate gas, we can shift-select another to have 3
* Shift-rightclick selected mining workers into gas so they return minerals first before going to gas


1st
---

* Structure vision is only 1(around itself) during construction
* 30 Probes on natural when the 3rd finishes is standard. Do this so that you can transfer probes and almost saturate 3rd right away.

* How to analyze replays
 * 



## November

15th
----

* Going hellion-cyclone Vs Zerg, Refinery before barracks, skip reaper, build first factory before CC, put reactors on first two factories. Third factory gets tech lab and rockets. 
* Upgreade ship weapons and armor when going hellion cyclone. Skip ground weapons

Drunkthoughts: 
 * Terran: Position
 * Zerg: Angle
 * Protoss: Magnitude


## October


27th
----

When mech, break rocks to increase mobility and reduce chances of enemy surrounds. 


21st
----

Terran

* Need to work on keeping seiged tanks out of army control group. While trying to lock onto enemy nexus, it wasn't working because tanks are prioritized over cyclones. Really frustrating because it lost me the game. I sat there wondering why the nexus still had so much life until only afterwards I realized I'd never locked on. 

TvZ

* Opponent went gassless lings and third base while hitting me with lings at 1 base saturation. Was unexpected. I expected macro greedy zerg so I didn't fully wall off right away. If I kept my scouting probe at his base I could have seen the lings coming. I could've also walled off faster but was lazy on that. 


20th
----

PvT

* VS Terran CycloneHellion, Mix in disruptors to the immortal tempest army. Lategame, you'll mostly just have tempest disruptor


19th
----

PvT

* VS Terran mech, go Tempest Immortal Chargelot
* VS Terran mech that is predominantly Siege tank, Thor, Hellbat, go Tempest Immortal
* Around 12 tempests to one-shot thors. This is good number vs terran mech

13th
----

ZvP
 * 3 bases. 2 Base saturation with 3 gas saturation
 * Roach Ravager timing to deny 3rd base and/or protoss timing attack
 * Include speedlings in composition to surround kiting stalkers


10th
----

* Don't fight prismatic alignment with armored units. Back up and wait for it to end. 

4th
---

* In TvT vs Proxy Rax Reaper, build cyclones if I have a tech lab on a factory
* If I have a reaper, drop down two barracks



2nd
---

* Vibe Terran mech build notes
  * Build order
    * Supply Depot -> Barracks -> Refinery -> Marine -> Orbital Command -> Natural Expand Command Center -> Factory -> Tech lab on barracks -> 2nd Refinery -> 
      Supply Depot -> Switch 
      
  * Build 3rd expansion when we start the first tank


1st
---

* Played as Terran a bit today. Getting more familiar with the Vibe macro Thor/Hellion build.
  * Engineering bay and first armory at same time. Need engineering bay for missile turrets.
  * Need to stay on that tank production until I get 4. This is very important for surviving early pushes and all-ins. 



## September

28th
----

* Oftentimes I'll get distracted with the reaaper and forget to build an overlord at around 31 supply. Got to focus on macro while keeping him away from drones. 


26th
----

* When the archons show up, get the squishy boys outa there


22nd
----

* ZvZ scout opponents base with a few lings right as ling speed finishes to know what's coming and if I should throw down a roach warren walloff. r


21st
----

* 4 Zerglings are **ALWAYS** necessary when the spawning pool pops, vs reapers, adepts, or early lings. They can be used to stop my 3rd from being blocked by pylons or bunkers/engineering bays as well as kill blocking scvs. 
* Banelings are necessary vs 2-1-1. Keep vigilant eye on minimap from 5:00 - 6:00 during this timing
* Don't panic during canon rush. Don't miss those overlords. Build three before ramping up roach production. Build 6 zerglings to deal with zealots and gas blocks.
* When opponent pushes out, do counters. He'll likely have little to nothing at home. It'll divide his forces and make his attack weaker
* Reinforce brood lords with hydralisk on the ground to counter phoenix/void/viking


20th
----

* Vs 1-1-1, throw down a roach warren. 
* If I successfully hold an all-in and have a lot left-over I should counter attack vs protoss
* Get overlord speed to scout toss around 4:00


19th
----

* If I see a fast twilight council, get safety 4:30 spores
* Saw a new terran rush today. 1 base double thor triple liberator rush.
  * It hits about 6:30
  * If a terran goes one base in the future, with marines trying to keep me out, I should get overlord speed or at LEAST send an overseer in there to check it out.
* Vs 1-1-1 Get 12 safety zerglings at 3:30


18th
----

* Advice from a toss: Don't suicide your army over and over again. 
* Gasless zvp:
  * When overlord starts flying into enemy main, if it's not being attacked by a stalker, they probably built an adept and we should make 4 lings(around 2:45)
  * If we see a stargate, we can take 2 gases at 3:30
  * Otherwise we take gases at 3:00 (roach warren at 3:30)
* Got wrecked by hellion cyclone again. This time I added ravagers, but was too late. My initial roaches were a bit too late as well. I droned for too long. 
  I was really hit shortly after 5:00. I think it's safe to say that vs hellion cyclone I should quit droning at 4:20 and start building roaches/ravagers and lings. Zerglings can come in and flank from behind while they're attacking roaches/ravagers in the front. Should work right? ;;<3
  It seems to have a similar timing to 2-1-1, though there should be some earlier hellion runbys that I can decently defend with queens and some lings. 
  I also got super supply blocked. Should be smarter with overlord placement, or they get wrecked by cyclones. Z
* Feels like I nearly beat a terran today, though he went ghosts and was able to hold, and ultimately turn the tide. Infestors worked okay against the ghosts, but highlighted the need to master control groups. My infestors ran right into his units after their fungal.


17th
----

* If protoss goes fast stargate first, then he can get a nexus a bit after 5:00 and it not be a rush. 
* Roaches vs chargelot all-in. Speed-banelings are amazing too. No hydras(or just a couple for warp prism deny)
* Priority target high templars
* If a probe is trying to deny hatchery and is attacking my drone, we can tell the drone to stop, get attacked, and then immediatelly go to the hatch
  spot and build the hatch. The probe will pause for a moment when it attacks, and create enough distance to allow the hatch to go down. 
* Drop evo chambers when lair finishes in gassless build

* PRACTICE PLAN
  * Gassless roach build against protoss


16th
----

* Lost a game today primarily because I put down 3 evo wall rather than 2 evo 1 roach warren. Should be more patient and careful.
* Somehow got rally set into enemy base as zerg and quite a few overlords flew into their queens. Need to watch rally point. 
* Vs a hellion/cyclone terran today. Notes for that match:
  * Should've placed roach warren the moment the multi-factory setup was scouted. Hesitated. 
  * Infestors worked really well. Next time get them earlier. 
  * Roach/hydra worked okay, but opponent wrecked them with his mobility
  * My creep spread was lacking, and would've made a huge difference in this match
  * His liberators smoked way too many of my drones. He got liberator range and abused the hell out of them
    * A spire and a few corruptors would've helped with this. I relied entirely on spore crawlers.


15th
----

* Lost to deathball of protoss lategame. If I had infestors added to my comp, I think it would've been different. 
* Defended no-expand speed+baneling 12pool by following Vibe's stream advice. Worked great :)
  * Held larvae and started building lings when I saw his late second overlord
  * Blocked ramp with two queens
  * Started two spines in main immediatelly. Maybe too many. 
  * Started baneling nest in main immediatelly, foregoing ling speed. 
* Opponent went rush-to-lurker. I saw hydralisks but it didn't click in my mind "Oh.. he's going lurker". Instead I thought "Oh he's a fucking asshole what is he doing?". I underestimated my opponent rather than playing as if he knew what he was doing. I still won, but mostly because he didn't send his lurkers right at me. 



13th
----

* 3 Roaches to take out a nydus if they start attacking it seconds after it pops. Leave 3 safety roaches in main if being double-pronged nydussed
* Double up on closer mineral patches in early game. 
* If terran isn't cheeseing, reaper comes out 1:50
* Vs 12 pool baneling all-in
  * We can assume gas all-in if we scout enemy with no natural and zerglings coming across the map
  * Skip ling speed
  * Build spine crawler and baneling nest in main
  * Don't cancel queen on natural
  * wall of ramp with queens
  * Pull 2 drones off gas 
  * Skip injects, put energy into transfuses
  * Force ling engagementS. Even if it's an even or slightly unfavored fight, it means fewer lings for us to lose to banelings and fewer lings for them to kill our queens with.



12th
----

* Lost 5 games in a row, and quite a few recently. I think my macro has actually greatly improved, however now I think I'm macro-ing for too long. Also taking poor engagements. 


11th
----

* If first overlord scouts a barracks with a reactor and another barracks in construction, it's a 2-1-1
* Once Terran tech is scouted, get the ovie immediatelly outa there to prevent marine death
* In roach vs roach, missile attack is slightly favored over armor, but they are both helpful


10th
----

* Played a good amount of creep or die today. Was able to beat it a couple times. It definitely improved my creep spread, injects, and supply blocking, though I can do A LOT better.
* Need to work on my cycle. Overlord on each inject. Nail those injects. 
* I took a couple dumb engagements today. I should stop and think about how things could go and how I should react based on what happens, taking into account map terrain and state
* Learning how to do surrounds was a big deal. definitely improved my play quite a lot. 
* I countered a couple 2-1-1s today. That was awesome


9th
---

* Creep or die is awesome for improving mechanics
* Build an overlord every time it's time to inject
* Creep spread every time it's time to inject



8th
---

Been playing WoW a lot. Time to get back to SC2

* Protoss usually place Nexus at 1:25 after Gate


## August

29th
----

* Drop main-base scan at 4:50 vs zerg as terran. If we see a lair but they haven't taken a second gas, it's *probably* not a spire

28th
----

* Protoss 3rd expansion timing
  * 4:20 super greedy
  * 4:30 macro
  * 4:50 macro with steady unit production
  * 5:00 moderate aggression
  * 5:10 strong aggression
  * 5:20 or later is an all-in
* 


27th
----

* 2-1-1 Notes
  * Attacks at 5:00
  * Implied by 3 or 4 marines scouted by my first overlord
  * 
* Try this build vs AI a few times and then on ladder: https://lotv.spawningtool.com/build/92564/


26th
----

* When 3 base minerals are saturated i'm usually holding way too many minerals and not enough gas. Maybe start a couple gases before full 3 saturation
* Baneling nest needed a bit earlier against terran when we suspect a 4:30 timing
* Still need to work on those hotkeys, but I did partially-successfully hotkey lurkers! 
* A protoss built two stargates, and after I finished scouting them he cancelled them and threw down mass-gates, zealot rushing me. Should leave overlord on double stargates
* When defending vs protoss zealot all-in, make sure banelings go in first so that zealots are softened for the lings


25th
----

* Got zealot all-ined at 5:00
* Need to overlord scout Protoss at 4:00
* Forgot zergling speed and moving over drones from gas
* Forgot to put all queens on hotkey
* Poor use of army hotkeys (none at all essentially)
* Decent flanking as ling-bane
* Used ultralisks to soak damage vs tanks. Lingbanehydra followed after. Ultralisk speed was good
* ZvZ snuck some lings into his 3rd, morphed them to banes, and send them at his army of lings at home. Killed at least 20 of them. Nice.
* ZvZ Was ling/bane harassed early game and took more damage than him. I sent multiple banelings blindly at his army expecting them to hit but 
  he dodged each one. He had a scouting overlord. Perhaps next time I send them from behind. One from the front one from behind. Patience.
