When Whyatt pulled the Whyscalibur from it's stone, he questioned why it was he that could pull it. Surely everyone else had tried the same thing? I mean he went to the stone, and he pulled, and it yielded. What was everyone else missing? I mean come on guys. It's not difficult. "I'm like 13 years old! " He shout-thoughted to himself.

Nonetheless, Whyatt became the sole conquerer of the Whyscalibur .

The People looked on in shock and awe as Whyatt raised the blade over his head in triumph.

He shook it around in the sky while blowing airplane noises through his mouth, pretending it was an airplane.

"Why does it have to be a sword?! ", he shout-wondered to himself. "WHY NOT AN AIRPLANE! "

The People looked on now more in disgust than the shock and awe they originally had.

The People couldn't stand for this flagrant disregard for their sensibilities! The sword was a precious, sacred community monument! It wasn't supposed to be pulled by WHYATT, it was supposed to be pulled by somebody that knew what was going on! Somebody that would actually tell us WHY we're all here! That was the purpose of the sword! The People rushed the alter.

Whyatt was a goner!

As they rushed the alter, nearing Whyatt, ready to rip the poor boy limb from limb, they shouted "Whyatt, you fool boy! You're not supposed to be the one to pull the sword from the stone! "

To which Whyatt shout-responded in a completely audible and not-at-all thoughtly way: " WHY!? "

The people bounced back, aghast. They attempted to coerce reason from their own mouths but it didn't come. Surely there was truthfully a good and objective REASON they all had to string the boy asunder? They couldn't find it, though. They discussed it amongst themselves and came to the conclusion that, it turned out, very awkwardly, their beliefs about who should pull the sword from it's stone were entirely based on group concensus, and the idea that they should surely all be REALLY PISSED OFF if some asshole little kid should successfully attempt to pull the sword from it's stone.

The People apologized reluctantly and all went home, to find new things to agree to hate, fear, love, regret, and any other sort of cause they could figure up for themselves.

That day would mark the first of many great victories Whyatt would win against the evil forces of 'Consensus Reality'. That mother fucking bastard!
