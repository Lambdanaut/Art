Deep in a magic society
Crazy creatures grow
and if you look around enough
A bonk and then a glow
You'll wake and then you'll see a thing
it shines and sorta glimmers
"Please don't touch" The gentleman sings
"Or you'll cease without a wimper"
But touch you will because hot damn
it's beautiful and you're willing
It brings you to such a peaceful sea
and the emotions are so filling
Just like, you realize, your fragile body
and then without a meep
the crazy creatures cross your path

and eat you in your sleep.
