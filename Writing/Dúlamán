[12:32:31 PM] The Ringmaster: Unfortunately I didn't bring my headphones today :[ I'm sorry
[12:36:29 PM] Grandpa Josh: Was daydreaming to this song and thought up a fun story about a 12 yo kid, that eats a bunch of seawead and becomes OOMPA LOOMPA fat, stuck to the ground. Then after a day or so a hurricane occurs and blows him away across the Irish hills like a stone being skipped across the sea. After a while of this, and being in sheer terror the entire time, he rolls into the side of a small cottage. An elvish woman pops her head out and looks at him with bemused interest, and her twelve children pop out the door and run out to greet the big lump that has arrived out of nowhere over night. A little blue haired kid starts kicking the fattie's belly uninterestedly, a slightly older blonde boy grabs onto the fattie's arm and suspends himself in the air doing pullups on the fatty, and a 13 yo girl prances around the fatty with flowers in her hair and hands, throwing the flowers around the ground.
[12:36:30 PM] Grandpa Josh: continues
[12:38:21 PM] Grandpa Josh: The mother glares at the children in a punishing way, and they all stop and look down dejectedly, but then they hear a guitar playing from the distance, and they perk up and smile, looking in that direction. The flower girl prances off in that direction, and the blonde and blue haired kids roll the fatty along behind her. They arrive at a campfire in the center of the village where all the slightly elvish looking people have gathered.
[12:38:27 PM] Grandpa Josh: The fatty is very uncomfortable and nervous
[12:38:46 PM] Grandpa Josh: but the villagers welcome him, and they have a big gay merry song n' dance feast around the fire.
[12:39:05 PM] Grandpa Josh: One elvish girl sings very well and puts on a performance for a moment on a stage
[12:39:05 PM] The Ringmaster: ; A ; that's kinda cute in a weird way skdjfhlsdkj
[12:39:17 PM] Grandpa Josh: yeah, pixary
[12:39:48 PM] Grandpa Josh: The fatty fancies the singing elvish girl, and blushues and whatnot. It's very cute.
[12:43:28 PM] Grandpa Josh: Sometime during the merryment, the elvish girl disappears and then comes back looking worried. She explains that the barbarians are coming and they'll be at the gate any minute. The villagers look lost and afraid, but the two kids(blonde and blue haired) look at the fatty and smile mischieviously. The scene cuts to black for a second and then comes back and the villagers are loading fatty into a giant slingshot over the wall towards the barbarians. The barbarians scowl and look up at the wall, and the villagers let the slingshot go. The boy flies out and rams into the barbarians, completely buttowning them, and then he continues flying out into the distance, looking behind him at the elvish girl and sharing a last, longing glance. He keeps flying off and off into the distance, bouncing once again along the Irish hills, and with each bounce becomes thinner and thinner until he can start running again. He continues running at the speed that he's going, and he runs off into the sunset, back home.
[12:44:05 PM] Grandpa Josh: Blue head kid and Blonde head kid = Freddie and Roger.
[12:44:16 PM] Grandpa Josh: though I guess I hadn't thought of that until afterwards.
[12:44:17 PM] The Ringmaster: oAo!
[12:44:21 PM] The Ringmaster: Huh.......
[12:44:27 PM] Grandpa Josh: I think this would make a very cute pixary flash animation
[12:44:31 PM] The Ringmaster: omg I wish somebody could animate this somehow ;-;-;-;-;
[12:44:54 PM] Grandpa Josh: I would if I had more time. I feel like I could seriously even make it really good, since I can picture it so perfectly in my head.
[12:45:00 PM] Grandpa Josh: It would just take fUCKING FOREVER ;W;
[12:45:03 PM] The Ringmaster: YEAH ;w;w;w;w;w;w;
