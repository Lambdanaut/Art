I care about you immensely, and I know you care about me too; you don't know how much I appreciate that. I love you even, and that should be taken as mindfully as possible, because you KNOW it doesn't carry any other context, though I shouldn't have to state that.
but in no universe will I ever accept that what our relationship is right now could be considered a friendship. 
So I'm ending it. I'm not leaving room for goodbyes or debate. 

Kids starving in Rwanda or any other random 3rd world country. I care about them. I sympathize with them. But I don't know them. I'm not their friend. 

I, truthfully, do not know who you are, Sophia, and I don't want to care about somebody that I don't know.
