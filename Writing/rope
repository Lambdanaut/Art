CAPO x1

              C                G
Throw me up a rope I'll try to catch it

                 F                 C
Send me out your heart I'll let it be


Wittlin out our story with my hatchet

We ritualize our lives with well timed tea


C                G
Things we saw on television
     F                  C
Have raised us from the start

C              G        F              C
