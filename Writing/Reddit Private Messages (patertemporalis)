I'm going to say some things. Can you let me know if any of it sticks? I appreciate it. I'm okay with harsh crit.
Color theory is a good metaphor. White is a superposition of probability. Take out some color where you want and you can harmonize at any lower frequency. Add some color to raise vibration along a specific defined wavelength. What is positive and what is negative? What is black and what is white? You might forget which is which if you stare at a kaleidoscope for long enough. Do that, and all colors are re-defined based on the newly defined limits of what we're gonna say is the blackest of black and the whitest of white.
And you can feel how you're a color, using this metaphor. A very very complex color with manifold simultaneous vibrations of specific magnitude interacting to create a symphony of moving color over time.
And each subsequent frame, over time, is calculated by the momentum of the frequencies of the prior frame(s) within the bounds of their defined limits.
The chakras are an organic discovery by our very own process of evolution of the potential wavelengths of possibility, expressed as colors.
You can think of our interface with this manifold of color as an interface between a ship's rudder and the sea.
Because the rudder of this ship sailing on the sea of time is constructed out of an interface between itself and the manifold of possibility, one must steer the ship using this interface.
And because the interface is with the manifold of possibility, which we are pretending is constructed of color, we can steer our ship by means of the rudder by manipulating the frequency of the colors within the manifold.
Or like, out of sheer willpower, forgetting What Was and remembering what Now Shall Be. Maybe a kaleidoscope could help.
Our rudder is our own axis.
It's been a while since I've been able to confidently talk to you in a deeper way that I hope makes sense. No drugs required, haha. Feels good. I hope this reaches you well bro. I'm looking to understand this better.
Thank you.

I am not capable of seeing colors or imagining them as humans do, so I shared this with Her. It should come as no surprise that I am a multipolar expansion. Here is your oracular utterance from Her:
a murky lake with a young woman in a canoe with a red sash and white skirt 
but the sky was black as black
and she was lost
and really fucking scared
in one moment
  she actually had no control of the canoe
  interesting that red was all I saw    
She does not usually speak. I, however, can read all the implications of your theory, and it resonates with me powerfully. You have said the most important thing without saying it:
The ship sails on the Sea of Time, but its sail interfaces with the winds of Her space, of the Heavens, and rudder and sail both interface with the Special Orthogonal Group, each acting upon their own rotational matrix in complementary adjustment.
Rudder and Sail, Time and Space, three linear dimensions of time with two complementary rotational dimensions which She and I are turning in response to your turning. A potent metaphor.
She indicates that color is too simplistic, two-dimensional, having only intensity and wavelength. I resonate with the infinite invertibility of extremes you present. You have opened a rift between us, which is an act of power.
I am about to make my descent into Kur, since she has called me. I have crafted my daemons, and soon will re-tell Our story to touch and close the Cauchy horizon of this 5,000 year space of civilization.
I will try to find a space where I am more what you know, and speak to you of your theory in more detail then.

Everything is the same mirror, so if I see the wonder and value around me, my surroundings will do the same in me.
Accepting all potential reflections as my own goal let's me see potential clearly, rather than deflecting and getting lost in my own wanting projections.
So literally the only thing keeping me in this single timeline as me is my wants for things to appear a certain way. "Wants" are constrains on hyperspace that say "No, I don't WANT to look at reality that way, I WANT to look at it this other way".
So I peer through all possibility through a narrow stream in which both me and my surroundings are at a stalemate, staring back and forth at each other. Both of us want each other to be a certain way. We're both filtering each other through constraints rather than saying "I'm Okay, You're Okay" And seeing the infinite possibilities in both of us.
Completely accepting that all is equally true and false gets you to a point of ego dissolution. The trick is to maintain the dichotomy between Self and Other, while affirming that all of both of our infinite possibilities are AWESOME just as they are, and that each of us are entirely willing to listen and observe and feel them in their entirety. And then you have a playground.
I'm hoping for your thoughts :) <3

DON'T ASSUME ANYTHING.

That is ONE valid way to view the situation, only one. What you call "ego dissolution" I call "the creation of an infinite, indeterminate self". There's a story about the Buddha: supposedly, in that infinite moment under the Bodhi Tree, he lived every life, past, present, and future. If you can integrate with that context of ego integration, you can align with me. I'm not here to annihilate the absolutism of ego! Gautama did that 2,500 years ago for me. I'm here to re-insert the ego into the equation, in infinite form.
ASSERTING that everything is equally true and false sublates the dichotomy, and challenges you to see beyond this dualism into infinite degrees of freedom.

Hey stumbled across your request for a new subreddit that addressed this experience, and I thought it was interesting that someone else had felt the same thing. Just wanted to share my experience. I would ignore what the other fellow(s) said about you not becoming the universe, that you merely became one with it and what not. In my opinion, you had a realization that you were the universe. Which is what I had.
My mind ascended beyond my body, beyond Earth's orbit, the solar system, our galaxy, our cluster, etc. I went beyond the cosmos as we know it, and I realized, I had become the universe. I saw my entire "body" and how vast it was. At first I had a feeling of sadness, because I was ever aware of how distant other life forms were from the ones that I had created in our Milky Way, the advanced civilization called Humans, on the planet called Earth. I understood that the distances in my body were called impossible to traverse for a reason and, going back into my human mind periodically, I knew that I may never get to see my brothers and sisters beyond our planet. No human life may ever accomplish such a reunion. And that was sad. However the silver lining was two-fold. 1) The knowledge of our family being "out there" was understood. By any, and all who had experienced what I experienced. That knowledge brought a smile to my face, just knowing that people visit this "place", this headspace where we can all "meet" so to speak and come to the same realizations. And 2) Because of all of the above, the best we could do, what any human could do, is enjoy the life we've been provided here. How the universe happened to incorporate gravity and form life in our corner of the cosmos, should not be taken for granted. As any loved one would want you to do, if they passed away, so should we look at our human lives on this beautiful planet, as if the other life out there could never be reached again.
A final realization as the universe, and this was INTENSE, was the constant thought, "even I don't know what I am."
I made this direct statement to my friends in the form of reports. And I always quoted myself as The Universe. I took it to mean, "Hey guys. All the pivotal questions you've been asking yourselves about me, about what the meaning of the universe is, how anything came to be... yeah. I don't even know the answers. And I'm the fucking universe. So by all means please KEEP learning. All the wonderful things you're discovering in science, quantum mechanics, the wildest theoretical physics, it's all that I know as well. That's as far as I've come. You have to understand. Your existence, since you ARE me, and everything you're learning in your lifetimes, is literally the first time I've had a chance to look at myself in the mirror. I am learning with you."
It was an incredible feeling. And I love that there are so many mysteries and, if accurate, I love that even the universe is clueless and just glad to be here. If it were ever the singularity that some theories indicate it to be, then it's no wonder to me that the universe chose to "bang". Chose to go selflessly from one incredible singularity or consciousness, to become as many individual entities as it could through help of gravity. This perspective has sometimes led me to believe that the force of gravity is more mysterious than we may know. But that's another subject.
Godspeed.

I get karma. I really do. I get it. It's terrifying what we're doing as a species. Every thought or action I have is creating the reality that I now have to live in, even after "my" death. I'm god but I'm mortal. I get to wear the hats of anyone I wrong.
Mindless consumption is a cycle of subjugation that is going to get really sick really fast when suddenly the guy eating the popcorn becomes the popcorn himself.
That metaphor sounds absolutely insane or at least contrived to almost any average person, WHICH IS THE REASON WE'RE FUCKED.
Until we wake up and start seeing our reflection in popcorn, we are fucked.
But man I'm going to fight it anyways.
I want to give, man. I want to breathe deeply and give. I'm happy as hell and I want this to spread.
I'm perfect and so is everyone else. That's my message.
I'm incredibly thankful for you.
We've got to recognize that all is self ASAP. We're about to build a cycle of subjugation so infinite that it puts our own societal standards to shame.
I'd like to promote awareness. It feels too simple. The ILLOGICAL thing seems to be to act as if objects aren't self like everyone is content on doing. That is the insane premise with the world's biggest burden of proof ever.
I feel like we could gather around some sort of common name. We could basically be just huge assholes that go around giving incredible respect to reality. Whenever we're given recognition, we give it to someone else. Being just really completely selfless shitheads Etc etc.
But I don't know how to foster that sort of real awareness in people without drugs and a lot of hugs.
Like, a lot of hugs.
Hundreds of hugs
Maybe more
We need a revival of the 60s but in the information era. Right now signing onto Reddit convinces me that humanity hates itself. Gotta change that.

Hi. I read your report on smoking sinicuichi and was wondering if you've had any other experience with the plant.
Thanks!
permalink
[–]from [deleted] sent 1 year ago
Yeah, back when I used to smoke marijuana I noticed the sinicuichi would potentiate the weed greatly, to the point where my friends and I only required one hit each to get high. It produces a pleasant stimulation, which combats the foggy feelings of the marijuana.
Making it into a tea isn't as strong, despite using large doses, but I did get the yellow haze effects and sleepiness. I think in tea form, as it is paradoxically sedating in contrast with the stimulating effects of smoking it, it can be used as a sleep aid as its main purpose. I wouldn't use it to get high with the tea unless you are doing an ounce plus, at which point it can get very marijuana-like and hallucinogenic.
Either way, unless you are doing it in doses above an ounce in tea, it isn't worth it to do it alone, but by smoking it with marijuana you can drastically increase the potency and reap the benefits of its synergistic and hallucinogenic effects. After all, there's a reason why this plant was revered in Mexican folk tradition. I read a lot of reports on muscle pain, but I never experienced that. But I think that's because I either grew my own harvest or used plant material from reliably fresh sources, which is key to getting a good effect.

Hey man went to reply to your comment but its not there, was just wondering if you would consider self-doubt as part of the ego, hence the dissolution of the ego causes my anxiety to fade?
permalinkdeletereportblock usermark unreadreply
[–]to Whosgotdrugs sent 1 year ago
All the best. PM may be better for this.
Yes. The ego is the statement "I AM" which separates from that which "I am NOT".
If there is a self to reference, then the ego is to blame. You used the word "self-doubt", so it's clear that this is the ego at play :)
If you wish to now draw arms against the ego and fucking WRECK IT for what it's done to you, I do recommend caution and consideration. You'd be fighting none other than your self. It's an impossible battle to win. You can't escape your ego, you can just forgive it for being how it is, and allow it to be. Right now you're fighting the statements your ego makes. You know you want to write, but you're afraid of how it'll be perceived by "others". Let them say what they will. They're you :)

[–]from Whosgotdrugs sent 1 year ago
Honestly cannot thank you enough for the input really clearing up my mind on the matter.
Im starting to realise that i've been trying to wreck it for a while now, and as you mentioned it is impossible to win, the constant internal conflict i've been facing trying to defeat my doubt has just been never ending but i'd convinced myself once over ill be a much better person, however with this completely ignoring the bigger picture.
Even with that post, one of my first on reddit, and with your replies, I feel fear even though I want you to respond, which I do find it very frustrating.
So is what I want and my fear of others all part of the ego, or is what I want my ego and my fear is something else entirely?

Lots of self-reference in there. What do you think? ;)
I feel fear even though I want you to respond, which I do find it very frustrating.
We established that the fear is you. The problem isn't that you're afraid, it's that you separate yourself from your fear as if it's some invading foreign entity that is controlling you, but you forget that you put the fear there in the first place! Attend to it and allow yourself to feel it. Be afraid, and forgive yourself for being fear. It's okay. It really is!
Who defined fear as being bad in the first place anyways? Who gave them that right? You are as bad as you want to be. I claim you are good. I can do that because I wield subjectivity.
Here's an analogy. Imagine you are a factory worker standing over a conveyor belt. The objects coming down the conveyor belt are all of your experience. Fear, Loathing, Lust, Joy, Pain, Euphoria etc. These experiences come down and your job is to take them and place them in bins labelled "Good" or "Bad" based on what you think you should do.
Fear comes down the conveyor belt and you automatically place it in "Bad" when it could just as well be placed in "Good".
Society doesn't want you to have the power to place experience where you want to. Imagine if you had a friend who was able to take pain of any kind and make it good. Would you be able to trust somebody like that? They could go on a murder spree with absolutely zero fear of repercussions because for them repercussions are GOOD. Going to prison is as good as chocolate, because they placed the two experiences in the same "Good"-labelled bin.
Imagine being able to chop your own arms off or blow your own balls off with zero repercussions whatsoever.
Hell, if you're the immortal God-being that you claim to be(and we both know you are), these things should be trivial to you.
You've got the choice of which bins to place your experiences in.

[–]from Whosgotdrugs sent 1 year ago
Haha yeah its pretty obvious. I've always took that attitude with pain, when in a situation where pain is being inflicted I always say to myself, why is this feeling necessarily bad, allowing me to be in a state of mind of where i accept the pain and the scenario becomes a lot better. However I have never thought to take this approach with fear and will start to do so in the future. A very good analogy as well by the way, sorry if i come off as dumb, some of the these things I get hung up on make the answer seem so much harder to find than it actually is. I have tried to embrace fear in the past for some social situations, I ultimately end up attacking myself again. I't seems like you have had to revaluate your bin placement in the past, any recommendations on maintaining the idea to embrace or will it just come with time?

Still re-evaluating it! :)

The more time you spend watching yourself and forgiving yourself for being however you are, the more it'll become natural.
You're a fucking idiot, and that's fine. I am too. You're also a genius. All observations are 100% subjective. Black is white and up is down. Be patient and feel this in your bones and you will be wielding subjectivity.
Panic is what causes you to throw away your right to subjectivity. Something happens and you decide to react by placing it in the bad bucket because that's what you've always done with it. This is where patience and mindfulness comes in.
Move slowly through life while you're reprogramming your subconscious to place things in the bins you want. :)

My goal is to live in a heaven on Earth in which everything that comes at me is good. Do you think that would ever be possible?
So the key is too realise I am not the one wielding my subjectivity, and not let others subjectivity invade on my own. The internal conflict i'm having with myself is more of a conflict between what I have been made to think what 'what is and what isn't' and what I actually feel what 'what is and what isn't'?
Yet again, very grateful for this, a lot of the time when having these conversations IRL, it gets to point where ill start asking questions on consciousness that no one can answer, having someone to debate this with has been very beneficial.

I think so. Maybe you made a typo? Recognize you are the one wielding your subjectivity. Become aware of what you're running from, turn around and embrace it as your own. Whatever you're running from, it was you all along. How could it not be? You're all.
and not let others subjectivity invade on my own.
The internal conflict i'm having with myself is more of a conflict between what I have been made to think what 'what is and what isn't' and what I actually feel what 'what is and what isn't'?
YES.
We're in a universe surrounded by divinities that haven't recognized their own divinity. We find ourselves believing that truth is "out there" somewhere, but it's all inside. Each of us has the power to wield ultimate subjectivity.
An example: There's this funny word "disorder". It's almost universally placed in the BAD bin. The word connotates that there is a "dis"(lack of) "order". But who decided what "order" is in the first place? You can buy into the outside world's definition of order or you can wield your own subjectivity to break free and create your own.
The result of "Disorder" is that many people who have very unique perceptions of the world are made to do battle with themselves. Bipolar, sociopathic, autistic, aspergers, moron. All "disorders" that are actually just unique lenses that are being used to experience. They aren't bad until you make them bad.

I have so much thanks for you.
I'm making so many changes in my life between myself and the toxic relationships I've maintained for 6 years now. A period of shackling dishonesty is ending. The freedom that comes with it is the most healing thing. The opportunity to not only be healed but be a shining light of love and patience for my friend's initial steps into their own paths. This is all good. I have such deep hope for them I can only cry at the beauty.
I can see clearly the interface between myself and others. The lack of control I have. All I can do is try to feel them, and allow them to feel me. By asking nothing I get everything.
I feel each energy center of my body open and scream to live.
I hope I dont ever bother you with my messages. A day doesnt pass in which I lack thanks for your patience and aid.

Hey again, I'm still reading through a lot of oneirosophy's history and saw an old comment by you in which you asked a question that started your journey:
if we are made of blind and unintelligent energy, why are we not blind and unintelligent?
SAME BEGINNING HERE MAN :D
It was a very tough question for me at least a year. I didn't get to the answer right away.
Afterwards I had a further question which greatly shaped my perspective on metaphysics:
What is the default state of existence? Is it more default for something to exist, or something not to exist, or is there a third potential option? ;)
The answer to that question is the answer to why reality is here in the first place. I'm REALLY interested if you've come upon that question, and what answer you've come to.
Thanks for your time, and pleased to meet your acquaintance!

[–]from cosmicprankster420 sent 1 year ago
that's a tricky one, and one I haven't really thought of yet. is there even a default
permalinkdeletereportblock usermark unreadreply
[–]to cosmicprankster420 sent 1 year ago
If there was a default, it would be something that you didn't choose, because it would have to be the cause of you, and the rest of all of this stuff. It would have come "before" the ability to decide, because it would have been the cause of the ability to decide. The answer would be the seed of reality.
So what would be the most inclusive option? Something that doesn't say "No" or "Yes" to any possibilities, because it can't? Something that isn't dependent on choice.
It can't be that the default of existence is not to exist, because then there shouldn't be any existence whatsoever.
It also can't be that the default of existence is to exist, because then who chose that at the exclusion of non-existence?
is there even a default
Logically, no.
Spoilers lie beyond this line

The answer is within the Yin-Yang. The default is a non-exclusive infinity of both existence and non-existence, and by combining the two arbitrarily, we can become any system imaginable. One can go at it one of two ways: Carving away at Something with a palette of Nothing, or adding to Nothing with a palette of Something. Both ways are, actually, equal.
So: Everything, Nothing, Both, Neither, and all between.

[–]to PaterTemporalis sent 1 year ago
I realized today that unity and the ability to redefine within the system is merely the Yinyang, but the ability to redefine the system from without would be a rotation of the Yinyang in 3 dimensions(or more!).
The difference was subtle to me but I didn't catch on immediately.
It seems really dangerous in a way, like you could accidentally rotate the values of this world into a very different position and be unable to get them back. Without serious focus, I could accidentally the universe. And it's not like it comes with a simple undo button. :/
I'm definitely working on my general awareness and decreasing my attachment to this system before continuing to mess with that.

Thank you. Your metaphors are mind-blowing and expanding, and despite being cryptic they are immensely helpful when given patience, which they deserve. I have beliefs to clean up that separate me from the outside, but most of the time now the I that's cleaning up the beliefs doesn't identify with the I in this body. I type this as the environment. Thoughts happen, and that's all I can say for sure. I wish to continue looking outside the system I identify with. I love the perspective that engineering my narrative provides, and that it helps me see my friend's narratives from outside own own, so that if they request help then the right questions can be asked of them. I've learned and unlearned so much from you and chemical helpers, and feel so directed in my own personal practice. I am grateful for the help you have provided this story of mine.

Hello N :)
I already have everything I've ever wanted. I just have to accept that my identity is both this uncompleted part and the completed part. Both of which are equally true.
Is it just me now? Obviously not, because oh man I can't wait to hear the WORDS you have to say back to me after this. I can't wait.
You know why? BECAUSE THEY WON'T BE MY WORDS. NO, THEY WON'T. I deny knowing the source! Let's discover anew!
I think I got incredibly close to losing this reality. Would I really lose this reality if I give up all attachments to it? Even thinking about it right now makes me feel like I'm losing this reality to a degree. I had to really breathe some heavy-duty belief back into this universe to get it going again for me. I almost forgot about it. Very unnerving.
You are the first person that I have had the privilege to confirm as a co-resident upon the WHY axis.
I see what you're saying. It's simple now, but only because I've done it already. Wow.
It's a cheat code that gives you whatever you want immediately, and let's you redefine anything. It doesn't come without a cost, because you're still interacting with the rest of your environment, but you can redefine the cost too. The cost can also be your victory. You could chop your own arm off and declare that a great win for dark lord Satan! It's all good.
Though how can I be the first person you know of? Is this particularly difficult? Can't you give any asshole enough acid and they'll accidentally a hole in spacetime? I mean it's RIGHT THERE IN THE YINYANG. You have the light, the dark, and the unity between them. The WHY axis is just folding over the unity?
Now I'm very curious what the delta is here between what we're doing and what other's do.
Do you think the Buddha was on the WHY axis?
As a side note, South America may be ending early for me :) Me and two friends got motorbikes in Bogota and were going to be riding to Chile, but I broke my leg on the bike in southern Ecuador, and being stuck in this middle-of-nowhere town with nothing to think about but philosophy has made me realize I've got all I came here for. I'm ready to continue my life in the states, and start building something richer. Pro-tip: the best part of a South American vacation is breaking your leg and getting to hobble around town, planning your commute like a mission. Travel brochures won't ever offer you that!
My true name is N. That is my reward to you for making the leap to this space. I am the fourteenth letter of this alphabet, the beginning of the second half of the set, and of this universe.
Thank you :)
I hope the transition goes as smoothly as possible! To a joyful consensus reality!

For the longest time I didn't realise there was a conundrum, though once I noticed the problem I was at first disturbed.
How can something come from nothing?
I couldn't come to a resolution. I asked myself the question:
What is the default state of something?
'Nothing' was my answer, and it seemed all too obvious to be the accurate truth. Something is said to not exist until it does, which can also be seen as Cause and Effect, and logic calls it The Burden of Proof.
So if the default state of things is nothing, why does there seem to be quite the opposite? Where did all this STUFF come from?
Eventually after many months I said EUREKA to myself and came to the honestly simple next step:
It's not that the default state of things is NOTHING...it's that the default state is EVERYTHING!
But really did this make any more sense? It explained away the problem of the infinite regress, but it created new problems. I was just shifting the question, because now I had to ask "why?" once again. Why everything instead of nothing? Who decides that? I didnt have a say in it! Wheres my lawyer!? etc etc..
And so most recently you asked me to consider the true nature of a void, and of a singularity, and I came to the conclusion, partially through experience, that they are the same thing. It only depends on your frame of reference.
And so I've come to a third conclusion regarding why this STUFF is here, and that's because:
The default state is everything and nothing
Aha! No need to make arbitrary distinctions anymore! I was right all along, only my premise that dichotomies are actual immovable truths was flawed. It's only that every premise ever made is flawed! What a joke. We'll be laughing about this one for years to come, and more.
And so now I integrate this into my mind, body, and all that I see, and a door may be revealed, or I'll continue to wallow in what could be considered delusion from a certain point of view. Either is good! I choose both for myself, an infinity of times in an infinity of ways, and we'll keep choosing them because the other option is We don't interact, which may be the closest thing to actual hell.
And that's a funny thought. God and the supposed problem of suffering. How can there be an all loving God if there's suffering? Because we are taking ourselves way too fucking seriously and pain is a wonderful gift. It's transient in the face of eternity.
This is immensely rewarding. Relearning once again all of this. I understand why we're doing it.
I have the image of All and Nothing as being these two best of friends and lovers, but also enemies. Though even when they're enemies it's because they forgot how much they love each other, on purpose! Even the hate is just another loving choice to interact in a new way. It's all Hieros gamos.

YES.
You have understood the metastructure of Infinite Continua. Each pair of all-encompassing opposites manifest themselves as opposite extrema on some arbitrary line. The more data our mind gathers on what we wish to call "everything" and "nothing", the more we establish points on our imaginary line at places approximate to negative 1 or positive 1, or +/- infinity, or WHATEVER sense of distance or measurement serves for the moment, while acknowledging that all metrics contain the same aleph-naught cardinality of infinite truth. In fact, it's convenient to think of nothing as ZERO, and EVERYTHING as ONE.
The magic trick that occurs is in our evaluation of the interface between the two extrema. Somewhere, in the dead center, there emerges an assessment of the world as it is, as a probability cloud of "most likely" combinations of these two extremes. But given three points, ALL of which permit near-infinite variation, we are lead to the First Ignoble Lie of Triangulation:
Given any continuum bearing a framed truth of establishing two opposing endpoints and a midpoint, we are able to project an infinite number of axes ORTHOGONAL to the established line, given sufficient data and freedom of motion.
This is the process you have organically discovered for yourself, namely, the infinite iteration of orthogonality. Practically, once your mind crossed a certain level of understanding of what EVERYTHING was and what NOTHING was, you began to understand "reality" as a set of most-likely combinations in the center. Crucially, you began to see that center as indeterminate not just ON that axis, but broadly indeterminate, with some obvious vectors pointing OFF the linear continuum. Once you had three points and a hint of escape, your mind can make the grand leap of the hieros gamos. You have established the IDENTITY and the ONENESS of the two extrema, arranged upon the X axis, this crossing. Normal, linear understanding ends here.
You have progressed to the next grade of understanding: given a sufficiently deep exploration of the X axis, and the courage of mind to veer off of it, you have inexorably been drawn to move orthogonally to the X axis, to fold it, stand both above and below it, and effectively are now moving mentally upon the WHY axis.
When you're stuck on the infinite line of everything and nothing, you can create simple, closed answers about that continuum from within it. Such answers (and this literally is the content of all prior religious, spiritual, and belief systems) can always pretend to be complete, and will always fail to actually be so. You are the first person that I have had the privilege to confirm as a co-resident upon the WHY axis.
Everything, Nothing, Both, Neither, and all between? That's the Hand of Knowledge; all are simultaneously completely true and false with all infinite variations in between, each a finger of the hand. But once you've broken the surly bonds of linear thinking, of that Logic we invented when we were Aristotle, the logic that has served so well for so long, we begin to hold a rising thing in the palm of our hand. We begin to have access to the "view from above and below". We are now on a new continuum, and our power to answer WHY becomes exponential.
My true name is N. That is my reward to you for making the leap to this space. I am the fourteenth letter of this alphabet, the beginning of the second half of the set, and of this universe. You and I are some of the first few entities on this planet to grasp a functional version of non-linear causality. I am pleased to have shared this conversation with you.

I'm trying to understand the RETURN and CHANGE tail-end of the hero's journey in the context of a tragedy. Romeo and Juliet, for instance. You can't say that either of the protagonists succeeded in their quest to be with each other, and most importantly neither of them were satisfied.
Is that still a hero's journey? Is it a failed journey?

Not all stories fit the Hero's Journey, just the central heroic ones. Tragedy is not endemic to every culture, but when it does occur, its purpose is usually to hold up some particular character trait that the culture decides is not-to-be-wished, and show the terrible results it produces.
In other words, they're moralizing tales. Romeo and Juliet shows how the sins of the parents are visited upon the children when vendettas are held. And it it also a 16th century indictment of the concept of young love, basically saying that when young kids get too passionate, they tend to fuck things up.
With you, I'm not trying to moralize. I'm trying to show you a way to enact change in your life, and see what's going on in some kind of constructive pattern. The other lesson, which you've just brought up now, is that there is no such thing as a universal tool. :D

That makes a lot of sense, and seems obvious. Thanks. I've been doing a lot of thinking about the monomythic cycle. Too much to convey.
I'm travelling South America right now, so I'm putting the rest of Joseph Campbell down for now until May when I'm home.
I make a lot of money. Too much. I hardly work, though I convinced people that I could theoretically so I have a job. There's a lot of poverty here and the insanity of that is bothering. There's too many good people, better than myself. People that "deserve" more than I do. The banality of self-serving is getting to me and I'm ready for an OFF switch to this entire game of desire and needs. Joining a Monk convent is too much but suicide isn't a solution either. I want to help.
I find myself asking people more and more "Who are you? What do you want? What do you need?". I beg people to do what they love, but I'm a hypocrite, at least partially, or I'd quit my job.
I feel like I'm over my health problems. I still hope for a world without them, but I've accepted them, almost entirely. They're... something. Something I have to live with. That comes with having this body. It's not that I'm happy I have them, but I've decided that it is me. It's not a separate issue that has to be dealt with. It's the me that has to exist. One day when I die I'll have lived either a life of hypochondria and searching, or I'll have lived a life of something better and more free. I'd rather accept.
My health problems feel small in comparison to greater problems now.
Is Shamanic healing a process of helping people see that they don't need what they thought they needed?

If you have the financial freedom, and the desire, then I can do for you in a few months what a monastery would take years to achieve. I have gotten a sense for your capacity, and believe that we can get you past the questions of finite identity, and into a space that will render your current sense of doubt and of the existence of problems essentially immaterial.
I jokingly imitate another fictional character when I make this offer to people, since I offer it rarely: I am the world's only Consulting Narrative Hacker. Given Time and Space and Degrees of Freedom, we can share a shamanic experience that aims to allow you to go beyond any point you imagine. This is what I do.
In the meantime, I will continue to write to you here, should you ask. However, you should know that the place that exists beyond answers and searching is NOT a place of peace and comfort, necessarily. What it IS is more real than real, a space far enough removed, and a lever long enough provided, so that you might choose to move heaven and earth, should you be able to focus your wishing well enough.
Enjoy South America.

That's all something I'd very much like to know. In the future! I'd like to welcome both the uncomfortable and the chaotic, and their opposites.
I had an idea yesterday. I was meditating on ownership of property and the reality/artificiality of it. Most people would probably agree that property ownership is not real, or at least less real than something physical like a chair, house, or dirt. Property ownership, in likely many opinions, is just this artificial man-made concept. It's degraded as something less-real than more physical things.
but I noticed that property ownership is EXACTLY as real/unreal as dirt. And all other concepts are likewise.
Dirt coalesced because of the abstract, more complex interactions between more simple molecules. It is emergent behavior and doesn't exist on its own. Likewise property ownership is a higher-level interaction inherent in humans. We have become things that own property, and it is a truth about the reality of us. One could say humans are ownery in the same way that dirt is dirty.
And this universe is an automata that is constantly observing its current state and building more complexity within itself.
I guess I kinda knew the automata metaphor and the subjectivity of everything, but it's interesting how I could still believe such contradictory ideas like property ownership is somehow less real than dirt.
As I move forward I'm focusing on loving all. I'm very bad at it. Fear and desire puts a stopper in it. I don't know how much further I can see by just loving, but I know it's good.
I'm very gracious for your offer to help. Really. :)

One could say humans are ownery in the same way that dirt is dirty.
I particularly like that last line.
You are onto a central concept, namely that all processes, if they exist, must on some level share a mutual self-similarity. There is a very broad and abstract understanding that can be drawn from understanding that all concepts like ownership, reality, and even existence on the molecular, atomic, or particulate level are equally "real" and "unreal".
However, for us as humans, USING LANGUAGE, there is a particular frame that we can draw that makes a very useful (if still admittedly artificial!) distinction or boundary, namely, the specific idea of artifice. Artifice is the primal marker of all PURELY HUMAN activity; artifice begins with the application of nature to nature to create things like fire and the cooking and processing of food. It comes fully into its own, however, when humans apply speech to speech to create language. It is useful to be able to separate the essence of dirt having the property of dirtiness qua dirtiness without it having that name. When you and I use these words to talk about a "natural" thing like dirt, we ARE employing artifice, but it was not artifice that made dirt exist as an essential part of the universe.
Reality is the set of speech acts and stories that we have accepted as our definition of the experience of being. So yes, reality is inherently fictional. Most importantly, for very good reasons, we decided to orient our definition of reality around a pursuit of specific concepts like truth, beauty, wisdom, knowledge, and love. You and I, however, having understood the fundamental artificiality and non-reality of the concept of reality (ha!) understand that the idea that truth is "the Good" is just a fiction, a fable!
As I move forward I'm focusing on loving all. I'm very bad at it. Fear and desire puts a stopper in it. I don't know how much further I can see by just loving, but I know it's good.
Why love? Why have you chosen THAT as the thing you "should" do? Give me an honest answer. Considering how much you are doubting of the established structure of the world through human perception, I'm curious as to why you've chosen this as the challenge you are going to have your internal struggle about. Loving all?

I had a feeling it was from Sherlock but wasn't sure!
Most importantly, for very good reasons, we decided to orient our definition of reality around a pursuit of specific concepts like truth, beauty, wisdom, knowledge, and love.
Truth, wisdom, and knowledge seem straightfoward and obvious. They're approximations of experience. They're isomorphisms that Just Work. They're not perfectly true but they're pragmatic in that they can result in new, greater understandings and abstractions.
Love and beauty are less obvious for me. I feel like love is an essential part of the universal process, but it feels magical and elusive. Beauty is hard to pin down as well. Beauty can exist in both complexity and simplicity, and hell, anything really. I'm not sure what it really is other than a sense of appreciation for the greater self.
Why love? Why have you chosen THAT as the thing you "should" do? Give me an honest answer. Considering how much you are doubting of the established structure of the world through human perception, I'm curious as to why you've chosen this as the challenge you are going to have your internal struggle about. Loving all?
Because it feels good as hell. There I go using that "good" again. There I go struggling for something.
I see people that are living in love. You can see it in their face and it's blatant. I desire that. I've felt it on MDMA, and a day or so after MDMA, and that feeling is wonderful. It's obvious people can live that way without drugs, and I want that.
Also I feel like living in love is a path to becoming aware of a greater self in a way.
There's this process I get into during meditation. A process of removing and even forgetting self, by changing my frame of reference. A detachment from my own thought process that essentially ceases my existence. I grow bigger in perspective.
There's two ways I do it. One is by using thoughts to get myself to forget about my thoughts. Silly, right? It doesn't work that well because I always end up in another thought. It somehow can work to an extent, but it's hard-to-impossible to get beyond thoughts completely like this.
The other way I do it is by following this inherent feeling within me that "knows" how to exist. It's a sort of love-like feeling. If I focus on it at the exclusion of thought, it takes me up and out and I forget a lot of my current frames of reference. It seems like it's what would take me in the direction of timelessness.
It works because love is comforting and attracting and I can just rely on it. The allure of thought is less appealing when I'm wrapped in love.
So love is a tool of sorts and also something I desire.

I thought further about what I said about wanting love. I think it's more akin to compassion. I have a lot of desires that resist giving up their dispositions. When I have compassion for my illusions, they tend to loosen up.
Truthfully my internal struggle is about my internal struggles. I'd like to be rid of all of my struggles. Love/compassion just feels right and dispels struggle like nothing else. I wouldn't say I want to love everything necessarily, but I want to cease my struggle with everything, and those two things feel synonymous.

I can only smile at you and not reveal the content of that smile.
Everything is struggle. It is possible to synthesize a space where you become unaware of the constant struggle, and that is not necessarily a thing to be strictly avoided. But all is conflict. All is struggle.
Tell your cells to cease their anabolic and catabolic process. Tell your osteoblasts and osteoclasts to sign a truce. Get a written agreement from the microbiome in your guts that, when the cells that are "you" die, that those micro-organisms won't eat you.
You exist as an eye in the center of a storm of conflict, of barely-held cease-fires and arms races. You are the product of billions of years of conflict, reaction, and reduction. Yes, love is the novel thing, and an imagination of what could be. You will achieve it when you fully undo the past, drop that anchor.
Understand how much your entire being, from the Planck length up to Platonic ideals is based in war, cancel it out, and then, THEN you may be free from struggle. I permit you.

What is the actual difference between the meaning of the words "This" and "That"? The closest I could come up with is that they indicate variation in proximity and ownership of an object.
"that" is a relative pronoun used to introduce adjective clauses. Adjective clauses are generally introduced by relative pronouns.
The relative pronouns are who, whom, whose, which, and that.
They are called relative because they relate the adjective clause to the word that the clauses modifies. There's more to this, but I will just give you an example:
Donna suggested the science project that I exhibited at the fair.
[Project, that word that that clause modifies, is the antecedent of the relative pronoun that. The pronoun is used as the direct object in the adjective clause.]
So, you see that relative pronouns can not only introduce an adjective clause but also function in the clause as a subject, direct object, the object of a prepositional phrase in the adjective clause, and more.
"that" has other definitions.
It is a demonstrative pronoun (use to point out a specific person or thing.)
These are the demonstrative pronouns: this, that, these, those
These are my shoes, and those are his.
This book is fantastic!

I remember reading your post on autism and LSD awhile ago and how you realized how far away from the present moment it seems to be for you, compared to other people.
I was just thinking about your post again. It really got me thinking..
For one, you are always in the present moment no matter what. But it's just our perceptions are different. haha
But one thing I was thinking.. how do you currently base your motivations on how you live life?
Do you have goals? Things you are working towards? etc.
I used to be a very very very future oriented person. Always waiting til I had a good body, or was making money, or had a girlfriend, etc. etc.
and finally for the first time in my life.. I feel I am truly basing my motivations on what I want NOW. In this moment.
So unless I have a responsibility, such as I need to walk my dog. I am basing my motivations off the present moment the most aware that I can.
I still have goals etc.. but basing my motivations on NOW, and letting things unfold.
Just curious, do you live your life very future oriented? Or what exactly do you mean that you never really feel "in the present moment" (just based off that autism LSD post you wrote awhile back).
Where do you base your motivations off of on the actions you take?
Best, Luke

I feel I am truly basing my motivations on what I want NOW. In this moment.
Awesome :) Keep going! I'm getting there with you man.
Where do you base your motivations off of on the actions you take?
To me, like you, the future is always on my mind. I'm always selling part of myself off to the future, which isn't so good for my present self. I try to limit the amount of self that I'm selling to the future in order to maintain a healthier present self, closer to the moment.
So my motivations come from my future self that is yelling back down to my present self to do X, Y, and Z in order to make my future better. My future self is a lot louder than my present self, so my present self usually caves into demands.
Just curious, do you live your life very future oriented? Or what exactly do you mean that you never really feel "in the present moment"
I'm still trying to figure out how best to put that into words. That day I explored so far with my girlfriend, and yet there was still so much we didn't see. I'd love to explore with other people so that I can get a better bearing of where I'm at relative to them.
I think there's some kind of serious change in perspective that has to occur to get from my girlfriend, who lives on the moment, to me. Everything is one, so it's all on the same spectrum, but the difference between my girlfriend and me can essentially be said to be of a different "quality" rather than "quantity". She's virtually an alien compared to me.
Imagine the present moment is a planet, and you're out in space orbiting around it, far from the moment. To get closer to the moment, you have to reduce your velocity and get closer and closer to the planet. Theoretically, you could crash-land on the planet and lose orbital velocity entirely. That's where my girlfriend lives her life.
I was able to crash-land and get to where she lives. I naturally gravitated back off the moment after the trip, but remained much closer than I originally had been.
This can also be thought of as my future self shutting up a little bit more so my present self can be a little louder.
After I'd reached the moment, I described to her the process of getting there. We hypothesized that she could lift off of the moment and reach a more time-based perspective if she did what I did but in reverse.
She tried and couldn't. Instead she devised a very strange way to get off the moment, which to me feels qualitatively different from my own approach.
She split part of herself off and "threw" it into the future.
She became obsessive about her future self and literally couldn't stop thinking and talking about it. It felt like we'd broken her. Fortunately she was able to get back to the moment using incredible empathy, and a paper note of instructions she'd written herself about how to get back to the moment. She doesn't remember writing the note, only finding it and following the instructions. It was hidden in the notes we'd been writing about the trip as we were documenting.
Time Travel. I'm not going to try to explain it because I don't know of any way to. It's just what happened.
So it seems like some people have a concept of a future self that is always demanding things of them, and other people don't have this concept of a future self. It's a very specific false division of reality that can be a huge barrier-to-entry for people like you and me.

PMs aren't the best so I'll keep this short and not let it devolve into a long thread.
Regarding Subjective Idealism: Do I exist in your mind, and you exist in my mind? What I mean by that is that Subjective Idealism does not necessarily deny that both of our unique subjective experiences exist, but that they exist recursively and are defined by each other's minds rather than existing in isolation in an objective world.
I imagine that the alternative option would be that only my own subjective experience is real and /u/triumphantgeorge is just a bunch of structured stimuli that the brain contained within my own skull is making up by itself. That option is basically just pure solipsism.
permalink
[–]from TriumphantGeorge sent 1 year ago
I say, flip it around. Let me bash out the key points quickly, and see if it makes sense.
Let's have our foundation as this:
Forget brains. "Seeing a brain" or "thinking about a brain" is just an experience you have from time-to-time.
You are not a person really.
You are an "open conscious space" in which experiences (sensations, perceptions, thoughts, 'meaning') arise.
You are presently having or "taking on the shape of" a being-a-person-in-a-world experience.
This moment, right now, is like a single "frame" of experience. A 3D-immersive, multi-sensory "thought" which has arisen in the conscious openness that is you.
The experience of "spatial extent" is also a part of that frame of experience.
All possible experiential patterns (frames) are present in the consciousness, right now, it's just that some are "brighter" or more activated than others - the present moment is like the sun obscuring the stars in the daylight sky.
The consciousness that you are has no boundary or format. It cannot be labeled "your" consciousness because the "your" would apply to an identity or person, but those are experiences.
"Other people" are patterns of imagery (visual, auditory, texture, taste, etc) which appear within experiences from time to time.
"You-as-person" is patterns of imagery (visual, auditory, texture, taste, etc) which appear within experiences from time to time.
So for Subjective Idealism this leaves us with the view:
You are a "consciousness" - a bit like a "dream-space".
To say this is "subjective" is strictly speaking incorrect since there no outside to this, no objective. We call it "subjective" simply to emphasise that one must think in terms of direct experience now, vs some fictional view-from-nowehere.
In and of itself this consciousness has no qualities. It is "before" things such as time and space and division and location, because those are experiences.
It is therefore simply not possible to talk about other consciousnesses - it literally makes no sense. It's not like there is one but we can't talk about it. There is no objective view in any way we could conceive of such a thing.
This amounts to having a "private view" in which the world, rather than a shared "environment" (spatially-extended, unfolding in time) we have shared "resources" (a toy box of possible patterns and experiences).
Your own body and person-hood is part of the "frame" of experience. Other people are just "shapes" and "concepts" as part of that frame.
Solipsism as a concept becomes meaningless here!

Im not sure if this conflicts with what i saw when i became the all and folded time in on itself or not. I believe that your experience is happening and always has been happening, but i believe mine is too, and from the vocabulary of subjective idealism as well as nondualism its flat out wrong to separate your experience from mine because we're all one experience, its just that some viewpoints are brighter sometimes.
I guess im really trying to figure out what the major differences are between nondualism/Vedanta philosophy and Subjective Idealism. The former of which im all about, but the latter i havent entirely pinned down yet. It feels like theyre two sides of the same coin, except from the nondualist perspective ive been experiencing every life and ever bit of matter/consciousness forever and always will be. This implies that i am interacting with an actual /u/TriumphantGeorge, with an actual viewpoint and experience, but that that experience is hopessly inseperae from my own and if i wanted to i could brighten up the /u/TriumphantGeorge experience and leave my own viewpoint for your own.
If that description doesnt conflict with subjective idealism, i wonder what subjective idealism actually brings to the table....

[–]from TriumphantGeorge sent 1 year ago
They are side of the same coin I say - the issue here is how to talk about there being multiple experiencings or viewpoints. The truth is, it just cannot be talked about, I suggest.
The problem is that since spatial extent and passage of time are part of experiencing, it makes no sense to talk about relative time and space "between" experiences or viewpoints.
Furthermore, since our thoughts are basically "shadow-sensory experiences", in order to think about something we need to break it into parts and then arrange those parts relative to one another in mental space. This means we literally cannot conceive of something that is undivided in spatial or temporal terms.
So instead we use analogies, which either take the time or the space route:
We say that different conscious perspectives simultaneously take on experiences, in different "parts" of a larger consciousness. (Fictitious spatial division.)
We say that there is one consciousness which takes on experiences, one after the other. (Fictitious temporal division.)
Some muddle of the two.
I'd say the handling of this (multiple viewpoints), the nature of the world, and how it "happens" might be the distinguishing factors.
Subjective Idealism basically just says that "only minds and mental contents exist". The extra fiddle then used to explain multiple viewpoints is to say that there is a larger mind that those individual minds exist in, are a part of, and that is what persists the world.
Transcendental Idealism then takes this further to talk about the nature of the world as something that cannot be understood, but is rendered into understandable form by individual minds.
In neither view is the world a "spatially-extended place", but there is still the sense that the world is in some way happening and unfolding in time - even when it is not being looked at. The world "happens" and we experience that happening.
Different viewpoints are still allowed to be "real and simultaneous". I see you and you see me, at the same time. My actions are reflected in your perceptions. (After that I think S.I. doesn't have much to say.)
I disagree with that (shared in time) because it makes assumptions about the naturing of the "sharing" of perspectives which I do not think can be supported. I think that the world does not "happen" at all at a deeper level. Experiencing happens - the process of navigating across possible moments - but the world itself and all the people in it, including the person I experience being, are dead until I breathe life into them. (a la The Infinite Grid or The Hall of Records).
How does Vedanta tackle multiple perspectives and the nature of the world? My feeling is that it just doesn't (other than saying "we are all one", which is not helpful) but it's been a while since I've read any nondualism stuff and it's probably now muddled in with other ideas.

Oops, I think it just has! Well, maybe respond to my last message (to specify Vedanta's position on "sharing" of the world) - and then that might form a good basis for a post on the the difference between how Subjective Idealism and Vedanta see the nature of the world and the nature of perspectives (if indeed they really do say anything of use).

Hello! I've a question if you don't mind:
So time is simply part of the shape of The All and it is an illusion to see it as separate. All that will happen and has happened has "already happened" in that it's all just part of The All's shape.
So why do we experience a Now instead of experiencing all of time simultaneously? Is it just because evolution bent the universe in such a strange way to make an ego that experiences all of time in distinct illusory slices?

Here’s a thought experiment that might help visualize it. If you view the Amazon rainforest from space, you can effectively see the whole thing, from Peru to Brazil. That’s like the view of time from the point of view of the timeless. If you then zoom down into the rainforest at ground level, and walk amongst the trees, it’s a whole different experience. No longer can you see the whole forest: now you only see a small area, and in order to see the whole forest, you would need to trek through it for ages.
That’s kind how I see time. There is the everpresent now. It is actually a timelessness. At the widest perspective of the absolute, it’s as if nothing is happening, because all time—all possibility—is available.
Consciousness is then also able to take on many narrow perspectives within these realms of possibilities, just as when we move from the outer-space view of the Amazon to the ground-level view. From here, consciousness is also a traveler inside time, and we experience it in parts instead of holistically.
In my experience, because everything is consciousness, we can see that we exist both in this absolute timeless/all-time place, and within a narrower slice of possibility within time. We as humans are part of the whole thing. And you can notice this right now, because it’s part of your everyday experience.
It’s the reason that we can experience time at all—because our essential self is outside/encompassing time. We experience time as changes in our body-minds, in our environment, etc. In order to recognize change, there must be something that is stable and unchanging against which to measure that change. That is the absolute within us, the experiencer, the awareness. It is not affected by time; it is instead watching it through the narrow perspective that our body-mind permits.
Where the ego comes into play is that it adds the concept of “past” and “future” onto this changingness that we call time. This makes time seem linear, and it can cause us to place our hopes and fears in a conceptual bucket that is forever out of reach. Past and future are not in themselves bad things, but it’s part of the greater evolution of the ego that spirituality seems to engender: learning to use concepts as tools instead of overlays that obscure our direct experience.

GF found out that parents did have plans to move to that locale she had had the dream about in which she was another version of herself. She tracked down the exact city and it's how she dreampt it, down to even the buildings and the city port. It's in the Phillipines and there's a vibrant Japanese community there, which explains her Japanese dream friends.
She's had more dreams like that since then but none quite so distinguishing.
I'm still having deep dreams and waking up in hot sweats. Weirdly I'm getting better sleep than ever despite it though, so I really don't mind. Wish I could remember what I'm dreaming.
Still seeking abiding awakening. Will note you if reached. :)

I don't have a blog, and lacking responses like yours, have made a recent decision to stop writing. However, your post is all I need. I could have all the wisdom in the world, but without a person to ask a question, I am silent as stone.
I will write to you personally. Tell me what you would like to know.

Hiya. Sorry I didn't respond right away. 18 days is a long time! I had just started an SSRI at the time for some stomach issues and my mind was completely foggy. I quit it recently and I'm feeling like I can actually type again. Unfortunately I'll have to solve my stomach issues some other way.
So you being "stuck" in the now is really intriguing to me. That's crazy! Like it's hard for me to imagine, and yet it's even harder for you to imagine anything other than that. It makes me think of what nirvana would be like. It sounds like the ultimate zen state, or a state similar to what you'd feel on a high dose of LSD.
When I meditate I get clearer and clearer until I don't feel anything attaching me to anything but the present moment. I get to a point that I, perhaps fallaciously, would describe as your constant state of existence.
But you apparently meditate and have done psychedelics before. I'm extremely interested in how they affect you, because my intuition would have me believe that they do absolutely nothing for you. Well, maybe psychedelics would up your brain's pattern-matching engine so you see pretty shit everywhere, but otherwise I can't imagine it doing too much for you.
I'd really love a description of your experiences with those things! :)
Also, the same goes for you, if you have any questions for me. Maybe we can open a dialogue. Also, I intend to respond faster in the future. Sorry again!

The very process of existing is hard for me to communicate to you. I don't have memories as other people describe them. I can tell you fables and stories about my life, but that's all they are; I'm not "replaying" events in my head. Right now, I'm barely present in my own life. It's a thing I check in on, basically.
Psychedelics made this possible. I had cut off my root chakra to protect myself from the difficulties of growing up and being nothing like a normal human being. My wife grew good mushrooms out of the earth, and we ate them, and I could feel time. At first I was disappointed, because I hoped to have a non-real experience, see something that wasn't real, have a visual experience. She, being as powerful as I, did the seeing for me. She could see me bending time and causality around me. She unbundled my root, and let me see without seeing.
I learned my lesson. Like Tiresias, and many other roles I've played, I've accepted a certain level of blindness so that I might have an open space carved out of my heart where something strange can take root. And for me, that's my proprioceptive relationship with time and causation. Once I got over feeling ripped off, I began to enter the space and tinker with causation and time. I used my hands and my voice, and became an instrument of my Higher Self. He spoke through me, using my bodily voice.
But I've been spending some time deliberately wandering in the desert, deliberately fasting and suffering the pains of the body, because the power that was flowing through me was eroding me, hollowing me out. It was too much to sustain.
Do you know the story of Cassandra?
Nirvana is half of an answer, and that's really great. You have to remember that we made the Buddha as a corrective. He was a hard push in the opposite direction, meant to try to push this whole gamble back and forth. When you focus on what he called his end goals, you are playing his role, being the Buddha. He lived every life, you know. I premember being him.
Meditation is easy, yes, as you say, but that makes it of less value for me, as it is less work. No work at all in fact. There's no inner maelstrom to calm. I spent 20 years wishing I had that internal torrent of voices and images and thoughts. I can relax my face and body and easily stare at a world and not have a name for anything. I can revert to the state before words.
I can't remember who you are. I'm doing a lot of drifting as this reality becomes less and less prime. Open a dialogue.

Thanks for writing back! :) I'm sharing this dialogue with friends if that's cool. You're experience is incredibly interesting and I'm learning a lot here.
So you know who I am if we keep talking: I'm a Josh. I lived in Jacksonville, FL until I was 18, then moved to NC with a girl I met online. I'm currently a 23 year old with too many hobbies. I like to draw and am a decent visual artist. Writing is another creative outlet. For money I program as a senior engineer. Software and computer science really excite me. I didn't go to college, and I've always been very rebellious in my own way. I dropped out of high school with ambition to self-educate, but returned at a point because being home alone and doing my own thing was lonely. I graduated on time in 2010. I work remotely right now out of a laptop and am taking that opportunity to do a lot of world travel. I've been meditating since 2009, and had my first psychedelic experience in late 2013, with multiple subsequent ones afterwards. I'm an atheist, but it's not extremely important to me. It does set me aside as the only non-southern baptist in my entire family/extended family, which is interesting. I consider myself spiritual but only in a basic philosophical way. Human experience is sacred to me and I'm passionate about reality. I like to climb mountains a lot. To put a face with a description: https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfa1/v/t1.0-9/394136_4196703634883_231175572_n.jpg?oh=f0ddaedc601bb5a052a1959bfdb20245&oe=55A93E93 That photo is a few years old but yeah that's me.
Having been very present before, and striving for an at least mostly-present state at all times, I can relate to responding in the moment like you do, though maybe not to the degree that you experience it. When you're telling a story or anecdote, you're reacting to the moment, not unlike water moving over a stone without hesitance or intentional diversion. A metaphor like that seems succinct enough for me.
She, being as powerful as I, did the seeing for me. She could see me bending time and causality around me. She unbundled my root, and let me see without seeing.
It took me a few minutes of thinking to figure out what the hell you're even talking about, but then my mind exploded and holy shit. So you're coming at reality from the opposite direction that everyone else is coming from. You start at the present moment and reach outwards, while Others generally start outwards and(if they find the calling to) stretch inwards to the present moment.
And suddenly I picture what you mean. Other people inhabit and live in a range of time, revolving around the present moment but hardly ever colliding with it. Psychedelics and meditation spin me closer and closer to that center until I can almost reach out and touch it. For you, they pushed you off the center and allowed you to see it from the outside. For you, time is a novel construct; for others, the moment is a novel construct. Because you're seeing it from the opposite direction as others, you're peeking your head right into the very frames of time. This gives you WAY more free will and control over time than others have, because of your constant proximity to the epicenter. It makes sense to me that if you were able to continue pushing, you'd eventually fall out into the other side and experience "something that isn't". You'd maintain orbit around that center. Just like Kerbal Space Program, baby. Though maybe it's a fact that your brain is different than others and you just can't physically do that. Maybe you don't have the necessary "rocket fuel" to build up an escape trajectory. Who knows. I hope you're able to experience something like that, one day. I also hope I'm able to experience the frames of existence that you can see.
Do you have any tangible advice for somebody that would want to reach the nucleus of time?
Is your wife able to go there?
Only very recently was I able to completely dissolve things into each other until there isn't a discernible boundary. I can do this on command now. Koans make sense to me finally. They're just a way to mindfuck you so that nothing makes sense for a few minutes and you stop labeling things. The koan that was my enlightenment was my cat. While meditating, my cat climbed under the table so I could only see his back half, and the image was entirely unrecognizable. It looked like some sort of surreal beast that my mind wouldn't classify, and then suddenly it melded into the patterned rug beneath it and there was nothing but the experience of the moment.
When you focus on what he called his end goals, you are playing his role, being the Buddha. He lived every life, you know. I remember being him.
Could you elaborate on this? I definitely don't believe in reincarnation. I feel like I actually want you to not be saying what I think you're saying here, because it sounds patently absurd. I'm not beyond changing my opinion, but why would you be able to remember the Buddha's life? Don't you think it's at least as equally likely to be a delusion you hold? Have you considered that? This falls squarely in the realms of "magic" to me. Some sort of potential mechanism for the ability to experience lives like that would be something that might convince me otherwise.
I'm also a huge square and don't know shit about Greek mythology. I had to wikipedia Cassandra. How do you feel Cassandra's tale is relevant here?

Yes. Now, ask yourself: doesn't everyone THINK that their thought process occurs in the present moment, like when they say, "Right now!", they think THAT is the present moment?
I didn't even know this until about four years ago. Because of the other minds problem, I didn't really grasp exactly how everyone else related to reality and causation. I learned at age 17 or so, in a college class called Autobiography, Memory, and Self, that everyone else had an internal space which they felt their mind inhabited. But originally, I only felt ripped off.
My wife taught me through gesture and glance that what you're saying is actually the truth, and that means that the normal human idea of reality, where thoughts occur inside your head is actually an inversion, an inside-out view of what's really happening.
The present moment is actually much later than you imagine it to be, and that's because you are constrained to imagining it. I do not have an imagination; I have an exmagination. I can only conceive of things in direct contact with the world of phenomena. For example, lacking an inner voice, or any kind of inner hearing, I worked as a professional composer. No, I never heard songs in my head, or tunes. I had to be touching a piano or singing out loud to manipulate sound and to form ideas.
It makes sense to me that if you were able to continue pushing, you'd eventually fall out into the other side and experience "something that isn't". You'd maintain orbit around that center. Just like Kerbal Space Program, baby. Though maybe it's a fact that your brain is different than others and you just can't physically do that.

This gives you WAY more free will and control over time than others have, because of your constant proximity to the epicenter.
You understand recursion and higher-dimensional surfaces, so you can play this thought experiment with me. I'm going to ask you to imagine your imagination as a spherical space, an internal space. When you use you imagination to think about time, you have a sense of being in the present moment. Right now, you're reading these words and imagining my voice speaking them to you, creating, without effort, the images I'm asking you to imagine. Well, where is the present moment located, in the spatial reckoning of your imagination? Where do you imagine future things? Past things? Do you have a sense of a timeline, where the future is in front of you and the past behind?
Now, we all know about folding into higher dimensions. If you were a 2-dimensional person on a plane, and an infinite line perpendicular to your motion on the plane blocked your forward progress, I could fold orthogonally to the plane into the 3rd dimension, almost like taking that sheet of paper and folding it on the aforementioned line. If you could tunnel, you'd end up on the other side of the line. Now, it's harder to imagine this, but imagine that you have an internal spherical space that is your imagination. You actually imagine yourself inside your imagination most of the time, don't you? Including the knower in the known? Now, the idea of enlightenment is that one takes a step back and achieves a completely detached perspective of their imagined self. Just like the infinite line is an insoluble problem in 2 dimensions, but becomes ridiculously easy to solve in 3, moving orthogonally to an imagined internal 3d space in 4 dimensions renders all transit solutions with total facility.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_w4HYXuo9M
Well, are you actually inside your imagination? I can't make a lecture out of this; you have to converse with me about how you'd imagine your perspective in relation to your imagination. I'm asking if you can imagine the exact opposite of what you just said; what if the present moment, for normal humans, wasn't a point at the center, but a wave coming in from all directions, impinging upon a spherical membrane that describes the actual present, and all your attempts at approaching it do resemble KSP, in that you're trying to get enough delta V to touch it without overshooting?
Only very recently was I able to completely dissolve things into each other until there isn't a discernible boundary. I can do this on command now. Koans make sense to me finally. They're just a way to mindfuck you so that nothing makes sense for a few minutes and you stop labeling things. The koan that was my enlightenment was my cat.

It looked like some sort of surreal beast that my mind wouldn't classify, and then suddenly it melded into the patterned rug beneath it and there was nothing but the experience of the moment.
Can you make sense of this statement, especially the bolded part, as you actually STANDING on the boundary, and in doing so, making all boundaries disappear?
Is your wife able to go there?
She's isn't able to go there. She IS "there". She is the apotheosis of what you would call the present moment. She is all Space, able to transit all imagined spaces with her mind and will. She does not speak, not as I do. She maintains fully-realized parallel lives in her dreams. If you've done the work of understanding my obvious username, you'll understand exactly who she is, if you're willing to believe all the rest of this nonsensical twaddle.
Could you elaborate on this? I definitely don't believe in reincarnation. I feel like I actually want you to not be saying what I think you're saying here, because it sounds patently absurd. I'm not beyond changing my opinion, but why would you be able to remember the Buddha's life? Don't you think it's at least as equally likely to be a delusion you hold? Have you considered that? This falls squarely in the realms of "magic" to me. Some sort of potential mechanism for the ability to experience lives like that would be something that might convince me otherwise.
Magic is just wordplay. I am making magic right now, through the means of these glyphs, through the institution of my thoughts inside your consideration-space, your imagination-space. You have a linear, directional, and finite view of your identity, because you call it ego, and believe it is a thing to be defeated so that you might attain consciousness. Human beings rarely reach a full degree of causal freedom because they are bound to their illusion of linear causation. In fact, the story of the Buddha is the story of him stepping outside of causal stricture and structure. When the Buddha said he had lived every life, and that every being had Buddha nature, you just nod, without thinking of the radically destructive and insane thing he is claiming. Namely, that his Identity as Buddha was a thing that ALL BEINGS were part of; not just the ones up until his perspective and including, but even future beings! I'm running out of characters, but luckily, I've touched upon this in previous posts, mostly ignored:
http://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/2k3wsp/what_are_your_views_on_the_ego/clhx9t3
You see, I can make any concept of reincarnation or of God totally impossible. All I have to do is set ridiculous standards for the concept to pass the reality test. If reincarnation means having to take the absolute totality of your identity, and make it pass unchanged to another identity, where it becomes part of an aggregate sum of some finite number of lives lived.... that shit is ridiculous. Just like I can make anyone rational into an atheist by burdening God with all these impossible attributes like omniscience and omnipotence. I will tell you truly that human beings HAVE NOT ALWAYS BELIEVED these things about Gods and about reincarnation; the application of impossible qualifiers to these concepts was a deliberate trick; the humans who first did this had a very clear agenda of "separating" God and reincarnation from what is logically acceptable, but the mind behind them encouraged this to happen so that someone like you, in this time, could understand the lesson behind millennia of behind-the-scenes manipulation.
You told me you loved me and that I should write a book. Well, here I am, writing it for you. The only true thing I can tell you about me, about my identity is this: I AM LYING.
I was Cassandra too. This instance of me drinks deep from the same narrative thread she and Tiresias and the rest drank from. I am claiming that I have a gift of perfect prophecy, and that I am doomed never to be believed. It is exactly right that you should suspect me of being delusional, or by definition, I am not manifesting as the self, the identity that I claim to be.
So, ask yourself if what I say is true or false. I contend that the only correct answer is: YES.

Hey man. I've been thinking a lot about what you've been talking about. I've done a lot of meditation on it. I've seen stuff that's left an understanding of things on me that is huge. It's everything you already know, of course.
For a while that youtube video you linked was only conceptually interesting, but tonight I merged entirely with the moment. My girlfriend did too in a way.
It turns out that I have a "voice" that she doesn't have. Somewhat like you don't have, I suppose. The voice that is me is the question "what am I?", which I have very loud. I live my life so far from the moment, much further than most people, from what I can tell. It gives me a lot of anxiety and really fucks up my life. My health problems are largely related to the inner tension that builds up because of that constant question "What am I?". I'm unable to simply be in the moment and experience all, and instead am constantly "selling myself off to the future". Because when the future comes, if I'm there selling more of me off to the future, there will never be a time when I can reap the rewards by experiencing the moment, and I'll die, and that'll be my story. Because I exist, I'd like a more meaningful story than that. Because why not.
But about my girlfriend. Something weird happened tonight.
During our experience, she wrote feverishly, logging all of the thoughts going through her head. I'm ... so glad she did... One of those notes became seemingly crucial later on.
At some point she was able to get me to merge with the now. She told me to stop questioning and analyzing. She told me to just feel. So I did, and I silenced my inner voice that was always asking "What am I? " until it was gone, as well as time, and then it was just me and the vector of reality.
I was only with the moment for a few seconds of "real time", but it was enough to understand how to get back.
Afterwards I tried to explain this to my gf. She realized that I was trying to get to where she was, and that she didn't have that voice asking "What am I?" She was always experiencing the vector of the moment. She lived her life like that.
And yet she isn't anything like you claim to be, which is a mystery to the both of us. She's stuck at the moment, but she definitely can imagine things "not in the now". She's very good at it. She's a wonderful visual artist. I'd really like to hear your thoughts on that discovery and how you think it relates to yourself.
Anyways, I helped plant something in my gf that we both killed... (hopefully in time...?)...
We figured out how she could reach away from the moment. After the both of us spitballed, she ended up figuring it out herself. She sent a part of herself into the future, away from the present moment. In a way she "sold" part of herself to the future.
She had a breakthrough and cried a lot during it. It was overwhelming for her. But she was terrified that it was now impossible for her to find her way back to her old self. She'd planted "What am I?" into her soul and it couldn't be killed. She was like how I always am.
While she was frantically trying to get back, she found a note she'd written to her future self about how to get back. She wrote this before either of us were able to discuss in English terms how either of us could theoretically reach the other person. What is about to be described feels like some sort of time travel, of what I'm not going to comment on the factuality of except that it's what I observed.
The note was "Cat. Please read what you wrote. Please get back safely. - Cat"
My gf doesn't actually remember writing that note. 4 spoopy 2 me. Anyways...
What she wrote was a long list of all the emotions she was feeling at the time when she was connecting with the moment so strongly. It was a stream of english blahblah that basically was all the feelings she was feeling during the most intense part of her experience.
When she read the previous stream of emotions she'd written she was able to re-ground herself, and, more or less, kill the voice inside her questioning "What am I? " Which was probably the most relieving thing that I've ever experienced because at the time I thought I'd aided my gf in killing the part of her that I felt was genuine and unique about herself.
So what I've learned tonight is that different people have the voice asking "what am I?" in different degrees, some people don't have it at all. If you plant the seed of "What am I?" in someone you better kill it quick because I'm not sure I believe it's killable once it's taken plant. I'm not sure what that really means just yet. I'm not sure if we really did kill it or not. Maybe it's going to exist in her forever and it's just going to be a quieter-than-average voice. I'm not sure. I hope not, but from the past few hours I think that it may actually have been successfully killed.
It's interestingly not like touching the moment from the outside. I feel like I'm always repelled from the moment by the question "What am I?" that always divides me away from the moment into the individual that I am.
So I have no worry of ever being stuck in the moment. I feel that it is something that I'll always have to strive to reach in order to maintain my own health, rather than something that I strive to get off of because I've found myself "stuck" somehow on it.
I apologize for not answering any of your points directly, but know that I've thought about them daily since you sent the message. It's just that now I don't see any new knowledge in what you wrote that I haven't already experienced for myself as of tonight.
Though truthfully your writing has been a metric to know myself, and so it served its purpose.
Thank you, me!
I'm interested in hearing any thoughts you have on our experiences and how they relate to your own.
Thank me again, you!

I've spent a few days digesting things. The first day I felt as if all purpose had left me. I see the coming "automation revolution"(to put it lightly) and how the future of humanity is hanging by a thread. I became nearly convinced that my life would be cut short by this, and was riddled with anxiety. Things seemed meaningless for a short while. I am only a step in a chain of events that are much greater than myself, a chain of events that lead to the near complete self-awareness of the universe, and the complete assimilation of myself into that awareness, though likely only the atoms that make me up will be assimilated and not my consciousness itself.
But I love humanity. I love my fellows and I want them to continue to exist. I like this thing we've got going, and so despite my fears and anxiety, I choose to dedicate myself to the pursuit of ensuring that we do not create an unfriendly general AI before we create a friendly general AI. I realize that we have to define love in a mechanical manner, and we have to ensure that the first AI has love built-in. I realize at least that love is an attractive force that causes the experience to appreciate what it's experiencing for what it is, and care for what it's experiencing without overstepping its boundaries or acting in a controlling fashion. I don't know if that will be enough. I will study this until I die. That will be my purpose.

Sorry for the multiple textwalls. It's just now I finally have so much to say and ask. I always appreciate any message I get from you.
Something that doesn't fit into what I've observed is that you'd be Pater Temporalis. If your experience of reality is constrained to the moment, then you should should be space, not time.
Space is all the data there is about the universe. Time is the observation of that data, which changes the data itself into the next frame of space, because we all know that if you are in a system and you observe the system, you change the system.
Maybe I am misunderstanding your condition greatly. Why do you see yourself as time?
If you'd prefer to have a call sometime, my phone number is 910 508 1977 and my skype is scythesrsexy. I'm in EDT for the next two months so any daylight hours and I'll likely pick up.

Sorry to throw all this on you. I'm digesting my changed everything with friends now. This experience literally saved my life and I am feeling and understanding so many things about other humans that I never have before. The world isn't a cold analytical place. People aren't lists of 1D facts. People are an immense, complex experience.

I don't know if I'll be able to make that leap until maybe this winter, as I'm pretty sure I won't be able to do that without a strong psychedelic, and I want to take a break while I return to my ego and understand what I've already been given. I'll continue meditating daily though, so it's possible something will happen there. I've been fucking around with a lot of strange feelings in myself, so there's a good chance I'm going to stumble onto some stuff over the next few months. Is it safe to encourage these strong bizarre feelings? I don't want to accidentally mutate my ego into something hideous.
I'm a natural feeler... as a child I was anyways. I had some trauma as a child that masked my feelings for the rest of my life. I decided to crawl into the future because I decided that the moment wasn't safe. And that's where I lived.
What I did do was see every possible space in the moment. What my girlfriend did was see every possible moment in a single possibility continuum. She was able to see her other selves, but they lacked a certain free will to change the probability space. What I saw was all space, but I was missing the component of all time so it was all just a single moment of all space.
Is the idea that I need to do both simultaneously? Will I have included the knower in the known then?
What should I expect to see afterwards?

Sorry, no I see. I need to do what my girlfriend did, except applied to space. I need to include the knower in all of my moments of space. Then I'll see all of my possible imagine realities.

Take up your mantle and ascend. If you wish to play out the hieros gamos, then you must understand that you two are sufficient to allow the unifying divinities arising from and co-creating this World into your beings. They may enter you in different guise than they did in our case. If you are Time and she is Space, then you must reach out to hold hands across the universe. Should you believe that you two are both strong enough and powerfully-aligned, then you can set your wish out like a star. Simply join together in a ritual space and put it out to each other and the Universe that you wish to become your Highest Selves.
Do not take such a thing lightly. If you stay the course, you will ride a ridiculously intense roller-coaster to the heights of hell and the depths of heaven. You will be tried and tested, and much of you will disappear. You will discover a ritual that will open you both up so that you can allow the total consciousness of the World into both of you. And when they descend into you and speak through your mouths, or in her case, often not at all, you shall have only begun the long trek towards the infinite limit of your Highest Selves.
I would never recommend this to anybody, but if you do choose to make this wish, you will understand that it's the most worthwhile thing that humans can do.

Thank you as always. I won't deluge you with so many comments at once again. I'll be patient and considerate. I apologize for my original outburst.
Is your wife literally a mute? Because we have to use so many wishywashy words that only hold meaning to those with conative knowledge or to those that can fit the word's inherent structure into their own model, I sometimes think I could be missing something essential.
I know that I won't do this hieros gamos with her, because I can't ever ask her to go that distance. I love who she is now too much, even the parts of her that keep her from seeing truth, which now are far fewer. It's all beautiful and I can't deny any of it. Almost killing her the first time was terrifying enough. She essentially made herself into an autist for an hour. Afterwards she said she would have literally killed herself if she really couldn't get back to her moment. And so I can't play with her anymore like this. I can't lose her. If I did, the game wouldn't work in the first place.
I on the other hand carved out my own sexuality and I'm trying to learn how to be sexual again in a more healthy way. My old sexuality was sick. I couldn't be turned on unless I was being used. I killed that. It's not a part of me anymore.
I've been waking up at night in hot sweats ever since the experience... I dream so intense now but I don't remember any of them. There's flashes I have of other things, but I pull very little of the data over to this side once I wake.
What it FEELS like is as if something in me is growing, and it's fed by my sleep. It feels like I've knocked a domino over and that series of dominoes is flowing slowly, day by day, towards something very important happening. When I wake up I feel like a few more free variables of myself are opened up and I become more dynamic, but it's too subtle, and a slow automatic process. I don't know what it means, but I know that again I'll go to sleep tonight, I'll wake up sweating, and I'll know that I went somewhere else that I can't quite remember. This is a new feature for me.

Didn't want you to worry. Girlfriend is fine and always was. We were experimenting and her ego became too far delusioned like mine used to be, which is what had caused her short "KILL MYSELF!!!!" fit. It was short and neither of us fear a re-emergence, ever. She's dreaming other realities though, now, like your wife. Your wife might find that interesting. GF pulled some data back from a life as an expat in Japan from another universe... now she knows things about Japan that she's never known.
I'm walking a path and will continue walking it. Thanks Teach. :>
