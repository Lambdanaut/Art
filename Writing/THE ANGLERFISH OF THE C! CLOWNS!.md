It's 2016, and right now if you google "Clowns", you're going to have a wild time. Your reward will be to be met with two drastically contrasting dichotomic archetypes represented by a single transcendental character. Oh, and also you'll see Ronald McDonald. Ignore him. He's not too important. But Before We Go Any Further, Take a BIG MAC BREAK, and Don't Forget To Bah-dah dah dah dahh You're Lovin it.

Bozo and Pennywise. They both love you, but for different reasons. I mean, they're obvious. No mystery behind their intents. One wants to eat their own heart out for you and the other one just wants to physically eat your heart out, like, with teeth.

Oh dear, god, how'd we get here! How'd we get to the With Teeth!

Maybe I'll ramble now!

For my 5th birthday at Ronnie Van Zant Park, my mom hired a clown. In 1996, that year, the number of western pre-adolescents still practicing as Innocent Toddlers was, like, 7 or 8. That role was almost gone in the west. That day of my 5th birthday, when a clown stood before them, half of my classmates met an unquenchably ravenous monster called It, and half of them met a loveable wizard possessive of the other-worldly power to be able to magically make a rabbit appear in a previously empty box.. and also it could conjure up animal shaped balloons.

I'm pure, innocent, and Jesus, so of course I met a loveable wizard that day. I remember. That's exactly how I thought of him. As a wizard. And hell, maybe I could one day be a wizard like that too. Holy shit, if I had the power to make rabbits appear on command, imagine the BABES I'd get. Fuck Y E A H. That was pretty much my thought process at the time.

It was glamorous as hell!

This was absolutely before the invention of the IPad. Now my 3 year old nephew can google Freddie Fazbear Buttsecks and by golly he'll get it. That's in contrast with a previously unanimous standard of 3 year olds that had no idea that the opposite gender has different genitalia than their own. I found out about vaginas when I was like 12, man, and even then only as a sort of "well, buddy, there's no penis down there, I promise" assurance from my equally sheltered bff. Of course I'm an outlier, and I didn't have a sister of similar age so the subject just never came up. Still, there used to be barriers of information there, of sexual and other Adult Themes that you just couldn't know about. Unless you were raised on a farm, you probably ultimately first learned about sex from your school's library, or from that one dirty weird kid. Both the school library and that one dirty weird kid were kept strictly out of reach of toddlers. Now kids can peek at titties and bitties at virtually any age. And there's a backlash against that. Parents recognize that informational barrier as being a valuable role-definer. Many parents just won't let their kids have their own Internet connected device until they're older, and have passed the pre-requisite age-defined threshold. That's going to work as well as the war on drugs. It's the same logic. Outlaw and hide the bitties to preserve our valuable innocence. Once the news is out that seeing bitties doesn't make your eyes boil out, the kids are going to Google "bitties", if not at your house then at their friend's house. And unless you make it absolutely clear that the restriction is a ritualized rite of growing up that is guaranteed to be lifted after they pass the threshold, then your children are GOING TO BLAME YOU FOR KEEPING IT FROM THEM.

And of course toddlers are the clown's people. His demographic. His voters. Clowns had it good, because before, Toddlers had no standard by which to question the clown. The clown's outfit and makeup was respected as hell. But toddlers got more and more worldly, and now they(the toddlers) don't exist. They discovered the mystery that defined their existence, and in doing so automated themselves out of a job. Yes, there's still that "age-bracket" that we call toddlers, but there's no Innocent Toddler role anymore. If you want to find one, you have to leave the west. They're all over Ecuador, and other socially responsible 3rd worlds. Kids still exist! They just don't exist around a 24 hour television! They certainly don't exist around an IPad.

Again, if you want to live in the west and have kids, Thems the Ropes. You don't hide this stuff from your kids unless you intentionally want to create a rebellion. The animals living on the farm didn't really start to get miffed until they realized that the pigs were drinking the very booze they'd outlawed from the rest of the animals in the name of "protecting their innocence". Mom and Dad are secretly fucking in their room but BOOBS DON'T EXIST LITTLE TIMMY. Unless you want to hire guard dogs to sic on your kids, and many fathers DO play that role, well, you're shit out of luck.

Clowns put on makeup and make themselves disarmingly innocent. That's their traditional schtick. Despite having powers, they are approachable.

When Innocent Toddlers became Just Toddlers, the role of the clown was looked at in another light. Children learned that adults can hurt you, and they may have ulterior motives. That is the simple fact that destroyed them. Knowing this, they began asking themselves the obvious questions. Why would a grown man with Godly powers deck himself out in haphazard white paint, dye his hair an uncanny orange, and then roll around on banana peels and perform other socially self-degrading acts? What's his motive? He's obviously trying to affect some response out of me. He's trying to make me complacent. He's trying to play dead so that I become disarmed. He WANTS me to laugh. HE wants me to laugh, for HIM. That's when he'll eat me.

When his glowing lure was seen, the image of the Clown Fish became grotesquely transfigured into that of the Angler Fish.

Two children broke down crying on my 5th birthday. Don't worry, I still had a great time.

Our generation was raised by the paranoid generation. Our parents taught us to check our Halloween chocolates for razor blades, despite there being no recorded cases of somebody actually putting blades in Halloween candy. LSD has strychnine, Communist Russia is brainwashing your children, and the Scientific Conspiracy wants to fabricate climate change.

We hold our parent's torch high. TSA, PLEASE Fuck Me In The Ass!

Plz don't blame the clowns!
