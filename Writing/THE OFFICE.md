"WOAH, NELLY", Bobby screamed after Nelly. "HAHA, I LOVE SAYING THAT. BECAUSE YOUR NAME IS NELLY. " screamed Bobby.

"Yes, that's hilarious Bobby", Nelly replied, as if that was not hilarious.

"WELL, TIME TO GET BACK TO THE OL GRIND. THE OL DAY IN DAY OUT. THE OL SHINE MY SHOE FOR A NICKL. ", screamed Bobby.

He ran past all of his co-workers, leaving Nelly in the dust. Today wasn't like most days. Today was special. Today Bobby was getting a promotion.

Bobby ran full-speed into the receptionist who was carrying 6 cups of coffee, and who now had 6 cups of coffee all over her.

"THANKS FOR THE OFFER BUT NO TIME FOR COFFEE. BIG DAY !!" Bobby screamed back at her as he continued barreling down the cubicle aisle towards the office at the end of the room.

The receptionist screamed back incoherently and also burned her skin really badly.

Bobby grabbed the doorknob and wrenched open the door, slinging himself through the air and into his $400 office chair. On his desk was a written letter with a gold seal stamped on it. It read:

"
BOBBY,

FOR YOUR EXCELLENCE, THAT WE ACKNOWLEDGE FULLY, AND YOUR DEDICATION IN BEING GOOD AND DOING GOOD AT HAVING YOUR JOB, WE, WITH MUCH APPLAUD AND OF MUCH PRIDE, BEQUEETH UPON YOU THIS PROMOTION.

SIGNED BOBBY
"

A single tear rolled down Bobby's face.

The letter he had written yesterday afternoon and left for himself on his desk was as beautiful and as heart-warming as he could ever have hoped for.

That day, The Sr Sr Sr Sr Sr Sr Sr Sr Sr President Manager Bobby got one more "Sr" added to his title.
