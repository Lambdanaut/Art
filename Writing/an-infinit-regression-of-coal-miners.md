Our bodies are extravagant constructs orchestrated by the individual cells within them, and the same goes for those cells themselves(their organelles do the orchestration). And those organelles are of course orchestrated at the chemical level, and so on and so forth. Should we really expect to find Democritus's singular Atom at the bottom of all things? Something that you truly can not look any closer at? Something with NO extra hidden detail propping itself up? The identity function as material? The REAL god particle that sits there and says "I am that I am"?

I don't think so, but the burden of proof lies on those that posit such a thing.

Perhaps this is why Aristotelian rationality breaks down at the quantum scale. The closer you look at something, the closer you peer into infinity, and as we all know, π is an irrational number, and so one can never peer close enough to know its actual value. There will always be a further UNKNOWN digit to calculate.

We like to think that the un-calculated values of π are a function of the currently calculated values, but what if it were the opposite? What if the un-calculated values of π are sitting there, underneath the surface, watching us, calculating our objective reality for us? What if we are a function of the infinite?

An infinite regressive spiral of coal miners prop us up, as we in turn prop up the infinite complexity above our heads where the gods live, and their own gods above them.

Perhaps one day we will decide to trade places, and let the coal mine us.
