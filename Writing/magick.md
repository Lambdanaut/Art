Magickal experiments

Relaxed. Sitting in bedroom next to Catherine. Experiment premise: everything is significant. Looking around. Listening. Hearing the fan spin. Catherine's breath. All significant in some way. What do they mean? 
See the package box in the room. `DON'T FORGET` is written in big letters, upside down because the box is upside down. What does it mean. What could I be forgetting. 
I realize my speeding ticket is due today, with only a few hours left in the day to spare. 
I pay it online. I am grateful for the reminder.
