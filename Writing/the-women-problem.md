So there's a lot of talk about womanism these days. Women want this, women want that. They want to VOTE and shit. Women want a fair share of the pie, and that's alright. Men understand that women are fat, gross, pie loving obesities, and they can't help wanting more pie all of the time.

Fine, take more pie, I don't care. No pie off my back. (Please don't put pie on my back)

But there's an issue, here, right? I mean, it's not just pie they're after. Womanists are up in arms about cartoons and television, too. Did you know it's now illegal to broadcast the rape of a woman on national television? It's true! And they're REALLY up in arms about the Internet. You know, that "Free open range", the place where you can say anything you want as long as it's not a threat on the United State President's life? Well, there's another exception to that definition. It's free AS LONG AS you don't make fun of

1) A woman being raped.
2) Women being less competent than men in any way.
3) Women women women basically don't say anything hurtful about women.

So you might think I'm sitting here blaming women for this. I'M NOT. This is a man's issue. We've created this monster, you know. From the day we were born we were taught by our poor, ignorant parents that women are a special, sensitive beast. ANYTHING YOU DO MIGHT SET THEM OFF, OR ACCIDENTALLY KILL THEM. So women are raised up in this special superficial bubble, shielded from anything that actually matters, really accepting and believing that insulting them is a CRIME that they need to go to court over. Sometimes one of them gets insulted by a man, and instead of being a rational human being and realizing that the guy is probably just jerking around, they come to the conclusion that all men are terrible fucking MONSTERS, and that it is pertinent that they rally around a cause(womanism) to strip them of their human rights and treat them like the doggy monsters they are. Dramatization.

I'm being stupidly verbose here, but really, It's all summed up in this one, modern golden rule:

1) Don't hit girls

FUCK THAT. BEAT WOMEN.
If you see a girl not being beaten at any given moment, she is almost certainly being corrupted into believing that she is a special irreproachable snowflake. You must beat a woman to teach her of her humanity. The world doesn't revolve around her, and she doesn't deserve special treatment just because she's got a uterus.

And that's all there is to it. Beat your sister. Beat your mother. Beat your girlfriend, and beat your girlfriend's dyke friend.

Rape culture for life.
Respect.
