You're Vim. You're 22 years old and work as a McDonalds cashier. 

Today you woke up in a digital hell, and it would be pertinent to escape, before you are eaten alive by really hungry monsters

# Intro
You're at work. McDonalds; cashier duties. A disgruntled man comes up to the counter and demands to kick you in the balls.
You inquisition as to what the problem is.
He let's you know that there are pickles on his burger.
He HATES it when lazy, swinebitch faggots like yourself put pickles on his burger when he asks them to not put pickles on his burger. 
You apologize to the man, and offer a full refund and a free future meal. 
He won't accept it. 
He demands that you bend over and kiss his feet. He explains that he's actually compromising here, coming down from kicking your nuts in. 
You can choose to come across to the other side of the counter and kiss his feet, or take your gun out and shoot him square in the heart. 

If you walk over and kiss his feet, he kicks you in the face with his knee and you pass out. Game over. 

If you shoot him, the cops arrive and you have to retreat to the back side of the building where a man beckons you into his car to escape. This bit of the game is a sort of tutorial for moving and using a weapon. 

As you drive off, the screen fades to black. 
It unfades back to you standing behind the counter. The man is still alive and everything is exactly like it was before you had shot him. It was just a short daydream. You reach for your gun, but realize you don't have a gun. Employees don't bring guns to work. That would be silly.

You come over to the other side of the counter and literally kiss his feet. 
He laughs and says "Haha alright. Now about that free meal. " And the screen fades to black again. 

# Stage 1
The screen unfades and you're in a black room. You leave the room and find yourself in a dungeon. An anonymous voice pipes in and tells ...

# Stage X
You use the key you got from the minotaur's husk, unlock the door and enter. The walls are covered in indecipherable scrawlings with the letter "M" used as a prevalent thematic attribute. There is a man standing at the wall drawing furiously with a piece of charcoal. He is completely nude except for a bunny hood on his head. As you approach he turns around and screams "I'M BETTER NOW CAN'T YOU SEE. I'VE RUN YOUR COURSE. I'M CURED. YOU CAN'T KEEP ME HERE. I NEED TO GET OUT. I'M COMING HOME PUMPKIN. ". 

He then proceeds to run at you with the charcoal and stab wildly. You must dispatch him. 

After he dies you can take his charcoal. This will be useful for starting a fire. 

After taking the charcoal, Dungeon Master pipes in:

"
Oh, I see you've stumbled upon Charles. 
To be honest, Charles has been a big disappointment. It's good what happened to him.
To come all this way, just to lock yourself in a room and rave madly for weeks about visions of golden nameless forsaken arches...
Well, it can drive a man mad with boredom having to watch him!
I'm glad you're doing well, Vim.  

...

But don't dilly dally! The hellhounds are coming! 
"

A distant opening gate sound is heard in the background. From this point on, hellhounds will be encountered in the dungeon's hallways.

# Stage Final-2
# Stage Final-1
Dungeon Master tells you that your prize is waiting for you at the end of the next corridor. He knows how much you like feet. They're waiting; putrid and wet, ripe for your lips.

You enter the corridor. 

Men in black suits on the left and right come out and start firing on you. You have to dispatch them and reach the end. At the end is an office with Dungeon Master. His appearance is the same as the disgruntled customer from the intro of the game. When you enter the room, he takes a homing bazooka out and fires round after round at you. After shooting him, he drops his weapon and his skin melts off to reveal a blood beast. He points his hands at you and all of your weapons fly away from you and off the edge of the office, into an abyss. He runs off into the workshop. When you follow him, he begins to throw fire at you. There is a saw on the wall with which you can knock him to the ground and saw his feet off by repeatedly pressing 'A'.

He ends, bleeding to death on the ground, with a monologue. 

"
You right little shit. 

I give you an education. 

I teach you what life is ABOUT, and you saw off my god damn feet. 

You think things will be better for you up there? You think that that hell is any better than this one? At least things were exciting down here. At least you had friends. I've always been there for you every step of the way, but you'd rather throw away all of that just so you can put pickles on another asshole's greasy burger. 

Sometimes I wonder why you even bothered to come here in the first place. You're so selfish. 

Well that's it. You'll hear no more from me. I can take a hint. 

I know when I'm not wanted. 

I'm going to eat this gun now. 
"

Dungeon master then places a shotgun into his mouth and blows his head off. 

You receive "Dungeon Master's feet" as an item. 

You take the feet back into the office where there's a door that requires DNA proof of identity for access. You scan the feet to get through the door, and then you walk up a flight of stairs, where there is a door at the top. 

You open the door and a blinding light fills the screen. 

# Final Stage
You're in a McDonalds. You return to your cash register, and continue working. 

# Credits
The credits roll over a background of you serving customers. 

After the credits are done rolling, a list appears for you to record your name along with your high score. The list is titled "McDonald's Employee Self-development Program", with a description:
"McDonalds is dedicated to our employees, and so we offer highly individualized programs to help you attain your goals of self-development. Wherever you want to go, whatever you want to be, McDonald's will be there."
