I am pretentious.

Haha, sir, I make me laugh. For in fact, it is not I that am pretentious, but I that am pretentious.

Surely I jest sir, for I proclaim that it is I who is pretentious, when it is clear to all of me, that it is I who is the pretentious one.

This argument can go on no longer, sir. Is it that I wish to fight me?

En guarde, sir! Put up my dukes!

My dukes are at the ready, sir. I take it upon myself to give it my all!

I have my word that I shall give it my all, sir!

Then I fight!

Yes, I fight!

And I did fight.
