Humor me for a moment. Imagine that one day, after living a good number of years on this Earth and feeling pretty satisfied with your understanding of reality, you learn that you're not really a human being. Not even close. You're actually an ant colony.
You look down at the dirt mound that is your feet and think "No... No way..", but you can't deny what your eyes(made of ants) are telling you.

"I'm just a bunch of fucking ants!?! " you scream at the world(through your ants). The ants themselves, however, don't seem to take any notice. They're far too preoccupied in finding food for their(your) queen to take any serious qualms with your existential plight, which is probably for the best because if they became too distracted then the coherent being that makes up "you" might simply pop out of existence.

So that's kind of what developing consciousness is like. It's like suddenly learning that you're just a bunch of fucking ants.
