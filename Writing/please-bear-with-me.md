I'm glad that you don't hate me. I don't hate you either. 
Please bear with me,
When Cat and I first opened our relationship up I was a paranoid mess about the idea of her becoming romantically and/or sexually involved with another guy. There were a lot of things I was insecure about in our relationship and it made me sick with fear. Kaida described you as waking her up with your hands shaking at 5AM. I've been there.
I won't go into the childhood trauma and cheating parents, but I understand you can relate to that as well. 
There *were* some trust issues that were broken early on, and I did my fair share of reading her messages when I shouldn't have. A lot of it bubbled under the surface and created some pretty hell-on-earth arguments, and we actually broke up for the summer of 2015 because of it and other reasons. 
But i guess like.. spirituality helped me change. 
I stopped lying about my own shit, and I started owning up to it, and she was radically transparent the whole time herself. 
And I started believing that God sees everything, so there's no point in lying or hiding. If you lie, it all comes out in the wash; in this life or the next one. Karma is sticky. 
So that helped us build trust. Both of us trying our best to be honest with each other because we believed it was actually impossible to hold onto a lie forever. 
I was working in Manhattan for a few years... I'd take a 6 hour bus in on Mondays and leave on Fridays. I'd be home 2 days a week and they'd be hectic hours filled mostly with trying to take care of errands. 
So with me gone all of the time, Cat started needing to fill her romantic and sexual spaces in other ways. 
I wasn't ready for it, but I made a huge, gut wrenching choice to let her go ahead with it, and she started meeting guys on Tinder. 
The first time they cuddled, made-out profusely, and there was groping action. 
When I got home we talked about it and it was fine. It was way harder thinking about it happening than it was accepting it after the fact.
It also helped because the guy was nothing to her. She wasn't even interested in seeing him afterwards. 
It actually bolstered my confidence quite a lot. 
Though I decided I needed to make a change and I was able to move into a wfh situation. 
Over the years I took part in lots of alternative scenes with quite a few affectionate and experimental individuals. It allowed me to experiment and come out of my shell in ways that were truly healing to the fearful self I had, the self that was supposed to protect me. I have been theoretically bi-sexual for a long time, but fully accepting that aspect of myself and what it really means to me also changed my mindset quite a bit. 
Slowly, other men became less of a threat. I think the inflection point was when I watched a fully nude ripped body-builder hug Catherine for a long period with a huge-ass boner. I think I laughed. They were adorable, and really cute, and really stupid looking... because of the boner. 
At this point I couldn't care less about the other person's gender or relationship with Catherine, as long as she's happy and safe. 
So I'm telling you this seemingly irrelevant self-gratuitous story because I would like you to see what a path to trust can look like. It doesn't look like staying out later than discussed, and it doesn't look like hiding important details or disrespectfully skirting boundaries. 

You can ask me to never talk to Kaida again, and that'll be that. 
But if it's not me, it's going to be someone or something else. 
Right now, you're the me working 5 days a week out of town, and you can choose to allow your girlfriend to have what she desires, or you can choose to dis-allow it, and create resentment. That resentment will come out in the form of *something* nasty. Fights would be the best case scenario. Cheating, lieing, more skirting of boundaries would be some of the worse cases. 

What I can promise is that I'm not going to allow a breaking of boundaries in interactions with me. Going forward I can and will be direct about anything I'm concerned would make you uncomfortable in any way. You have your list, and you can move at your own pace. 

You're not ready for the list to be fully opened. That's more than fine. You're not ready for it to even be meet-in-a-cafe opened. That's really okay. 

But if you want to prevent toxic resentment from brewing, it needs a pressure release valve. Continuing with the discussed plans that I was informed of and took part in on Tuesday is the very least that can be done to allow room for hope. 

And if you choose that, I'm looking forward to seeing you grow throughout this. I can't promise you won't be hurt again. My understanding is that right now the two of you are trying to understand if you can even make it work together. You know the answer to that better than I do. I'm rooting for the both of you though. I want you both to grow and make this work if that's what you both truly desire. 

In these ways, I think me being around in *Some capacity* is helpful. 

> I remember the conversation of 'I would never leave you for Cat'. That literally isn't a thing with you. She considered it. It's literally a possibility and cements my fears and my justification for that division in the rules.

Ironically this is a thing because the rule exists in the first place. The rule traps her. If you love something you have to set it free and hope to god that it comes back. The only other option is to let it thrash in its trap until it's become unrecognizable.
