Bristol had been travelling for a long time, when she came to a floating sphinx in the road blocking her way. It rose a couple of meters above the path. She acknowledged it.

"Do you have any tangible advice for somebody that would want to travel away from the nucleus of time?" Bristol asked the sphinx.

"..That's a strange question. Most everyone else is already floating up there. ", the sphinx pointed in a direction that wasn't discernible to the girl, "Are you sure you're even making any sense? How would somebody even be standing where you are right now, on this nucleus? ", mused the creature.

Bristol replied plainly, "I don't know. I've always been here. I'm trying to get to where you're going, or where you claim you could be going. How can I float with them? " Despite Bristol's conviction to leave the nucleus, she still wasn't entirely convinced that there was any other place one could be.

"I see. Well, literally everything else is up here. Follow me.", said the sphinx, as it promptly faded away in an orthogonal direction from where it was standing. And then it was gone, with no trace left of it.

Bristol wasn't so bothered. This was how life was for her. She'd catch fleeting moments with others and then they'd spiral off away from the nucleus that she was tied down to. There wasn't anything physical binding her down here that she could discern, but there definitely existed some place that she couldn't go that others could. All of the evidence pointed towards it.

She began walking in the direction that the sphinx was standing, and voyaged towards the cauchy horizon with the continuing hope that some sphinx would eventually pull her away with it, out of the eternal lonely hills that she inhabited.
