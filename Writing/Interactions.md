Interactions
============

A list of possible interactions that come to mind between you and me. None of the things in this list are *necessarily* desires of mine, only possible interactions I am conceiving of as I type it. I am attempting to be comprehensive, and mostly exhaustive, for the sake of clarity. 

* Staying out past a pre-determined, discussed time, without all parties being fully informed.
* Chatting in a chat program
* Sharing music
* Sharing media
* Playing a multiplayer online game together
* Sharing non-explicit internet content
* Sharing explicit content(anything that a minor would not be allowed to view)
* Sharing explicit content(anything that a minor would not be allowed to view) without implying anything about the content relating to our relationship. 
* Calling through voice
* Singing together
* Ask personal favors of each other(like coming up with a list of potential interactions)
* Role playing with our characters together(A textual back-and-forth)
* Role playing our characters in sexually explicit situations(This is something I do with multiple friends who I have no romantic involvement with, and the important relevant premise here is that the characters do not represent us.)
* Sharing explicit works of art created for each other. 
* Sharing non-exclicit works of art created for each other. (poetry, drawing, music)
* Calling through video
* Discussing philosophy
* Discussing thoughts
* Discussing feelings
* Discussing our day
* Expressing care
* Express future ambitions and goals that include the two of us working together to achieve them. 
* Apologize to each other for misconduct
* Expressing romantic care(I love you) (Note that this is also something I say to all of my friends and family unless they express discomfort about the word, which has not happened to me before. However when I express it with you, it implies a higher level of commitment. )
* Expressing imaginations of being in spaces together
* Expressing imaginations of being in spaces together with physical contact
* Expressing imaginations of being in spaces together with physical contact that includes contact that Dylan is uncomfortable with occuring if we were actually in that space together. 
* Seeing each other in a public space.
* Seeing each other in a private space with Catherine's involvement/presence (without Dylans' presence)
* Seeing each other in a private space with Dylan's involvement/presence (In the case that Dylan is comfortable around me)
* Seeing each other in a private space without Catherine's involvement/presence (Private space includes parked car, hotel, a bedroom, bathroom, or anything that could have a similar energy. *Brief* interactions in these spaces for the sake of practical necessity are not considered in this categroy. It is of course very important that in this space nothing can occur that is not okay. )

* Sexual intercourse
* BDSM-like interactions
* Touching chests(with any body part other than as the consequence of a hug)
* Marking(biting)
* Marking(without biting)

I sometimes am naked at these events, usually for short periods. I also have nudist friends in Vermont that I visit and ride bikes around town in the nude. At neither of these events has the nudity ever led to a moment of sexualization, and I do not feel that it is a sexual thing.)
* Nudity of either of us in non-sexual contexts in private settings.
