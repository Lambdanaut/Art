I'm tired, mildly paranoid, and sleepy, and also tired. 

Last night at around 3:00 I was awoken by Bert calling to let me know that my car alarm was triggered outside, so I got my nunchucks and balisong and went downstairs, I opened up the back door and it didn't seem like anything was really amiss, so I yelled "IT'S WAY TOO EARLY FOR ME TO HAVE TO MURDER A WETBACK THIS MORNING.", rose my knife in the air menacingly, and then went back inside and went back to sleep. 

It's weird; I'm pretty sure this event is singlehandedly the reason I feel like crap this morning. My sleep schedule is so easily fuckupable. I think it might not be such an awful idea for me to return to my 11:00 sleeping schedule. 

Maybe. 

It feels like today is going to be a long day.
