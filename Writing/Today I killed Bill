Bill left home, upset and frustrated. He mumbled slurs under his breath as he walked. The author who had promised him such great things by commiting to write his story had, until this point, completely neglected to inform him that there was no plan. No draft. This was it. Bill was just going to be written out freeform, on the spot, all willy-nilly-like. He was to be one of those daft 3rd-wall breaking characters with absolutely no emotional turmoil or unconscious personal quest. This Author planned to make a postmodern DICK out of him!!

Then The Author got sick and tired of Bill's negative attitude and decided to stop writing him.

Goodbye Bill!

You're dead now!

Hah!

Piece of shit.
