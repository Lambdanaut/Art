Your obsession with peopl'n is driving us apart

Mark right between my eyes and throw me out your dart

I doubt you'll remember this but I've been doubtin from the start

So I hope you prove me wrong when you define me up your art



And we've been sailing all this time

But we haven't seen the shore

Sails are torn and tied

To our hearts and rotten core



Burning oil bind us to our craft and silly things

We've been burning for so long that we forgot what winter brings
