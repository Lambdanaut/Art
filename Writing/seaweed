Seaweed

CAPO 3rd fret


G C9 Strum pattern

| . . | . | . 

Going back and forth between them. 4-5 Chords are hit per line. 



G C9

Ebbs and flow, going up and down around each other

Seaweed caught in our hair, holding us together

Burrs burried in our feet, gifts from one another

Blood pouring in heaps, why do I even bother


            C        D         G
I guess I'm still in love with you

              C            D    G
And I'll keep holding your hand through and through

            C       D              G
Though this seaweed binds us, it's us that's holding on

        C           D      G
to say, once again, I love you



G C9

I give up once again, just to find my sweet beginnings

Seaweed caught in our hair, piles of our winnings

This stuff has left us so bare, the shackles in our skin sings:

Set us free Set us free Let us be what we may be

Set us free Set us free Let us be what we may be


REPEAT CHORUS
