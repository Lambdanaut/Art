We rip open our scars and three set off together
Put up netted bars and collect all the feathers
From the friends that we've lost and the friends that we've slain
Hang them from our mirrors in our thoughts they'll remain.

Burning tar flavored smoke melts the snow and the earth
I breathe it all in and embrace subtle mirth
And we laugh round the garbage and forget the day's role
When the fire subsides we dig the new hole

Safe from hawks and the cold, a stick marks a grave
Over ninety slipknots in one sitting i hope the boys brave
and I'm laughing from the popping of the cartilage in my ear
The cliche is pains all that's worth holding dear.
