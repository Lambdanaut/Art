[11:00:06 AM] Grandpa Josh: I had a dream where you three were in Wilmington, and we were going on a road trip to my parent's house in Jacksonville
[11:00:36 AM] Grandpa Josh: and we got there and stayed the night and hung out and played video games with my brothers Kyle and Nick
[11:01:08 AM] Grandpa Josh: And the next morning we wanted to go ice skating (in irl I don't think there's an ice rink in Jacksonville.. lmao)
[11:01:20 AM] Grandpa Josh: And the rink closed early or something, so you three got in the shower together to speed up the process
[11:01:40 AM] Grandpa Josh: and it did not turn into a lesbian fantasy, because you were all wearing your undergarments in the shower
[11:02:13 AM] Grandpa Josh: and I was outside the shower brushing my teeth and stuff
[11:02:16 AM] Grandpa Josh: then we all got dressed
[11:02:37 AM] Grandpa Josh: and when we were dressed we went to get breakfast (Eggs and awesome pancakes oh man they were awesome pancakes)
[11:02:45 AM] Grandpa Josh: and we looked at each other and we were all dressed really awkwardly
[11:02:45 AM] Grandpa Josh: like
[11:03:18 AM] Grandpa Josh: in formallish clothes that were ironed, but they looked like they were from the 80s. Like button up shirts from the 80s and whatnot.
[11:03:22 AM] Grandpa Josh: Also they were all pastel shades
[11:04:48 AM] Grandpa Josh: I was wearing a long sleaved pastel-white buttonned up iron shirt, and shorts. Which was  a ridiculous combination. Oh and my hair was done really well to accentuate my sideburns. 
And everyone was dressed pretty much like that
[11:05:45 AM] Grandpa Josh: and I was like "Katie what the hell why did we all dress like this? Also, Katie, did you just dye your hair pitch-black?" And she said yeah; yeah she did.
[11:11:09 AM] Grandpa Josh: And I said we should form a band called the "Awkward Formalities". ANd we did. And we became world famous, and all of our old acquaintances that we hate became jealous of us and hated us a ton, and we enjoyed that.
[11:12:09 AM] Grandpa Josh: and at some point an old friend of mine from like 1st grade named Aaron Burns joined our band
[11:12:18 AM] Grandpa Josh: and then I woke up
[11:12:20 AM] Grandpa Josh: GOOD DREAM
