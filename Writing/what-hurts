Awesome chord [pr0gression]

C7(With pinky down a string) C Am Em F G7 C C


What hurts, baby you've got it, I'll be here till you've made it on through

What rots, baby you're not it, even though your skin has turned blue



G F C Am

Cancers all the same

Taking all the good things that we can't fit in a frame

To be, you die

Here for several moments till it ends and then it flies away


G    G    G    G    C
Away Away Away Away Away


There's dirt, smudged in this locket. Feels true to life on your face.

One slug, just a second to cock it. Pinyatas dropping candy and lace.
