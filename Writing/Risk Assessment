# Risk Assessment

All values are on a scale from 0.0 - 1.0

value * success_chance > punishment * failure_chance + threshhold


Haskell Code: 
let assess value success_chance punishment failure_chance threshold = value * success_chance > punishment * failure_chance + threshold
let assess_diff value success_chance punishment failure_chance threshold = value * success_chance - (punishment * failure_chance + threshold)
