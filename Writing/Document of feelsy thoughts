Document of feelsy thoughts
---------------------------

* Sitting here thinking about solutions that aren't solutions and futures that aren't futures and plans that aren't plans
* potato pushpin
* put your dirty shoes in my washing machine heart
* 3 years, 2 bikes, and 2,500 miles from now
* It was like trying to go back to that Walmart of 2 years ago and it feels like they've reorganized the store and you don't know where anything is anymore.
* the Walmart of old is torn down, but that together, the four of us are going to build a new store, one that sells gluten free bread
* I'm choosing to let go, to firewalk again and try to trust.
* "a creek with nice smooth rocks in the bottom" "kittens napping in the afternoon sunlight" "the feeling you get when you bite into a cookie that's just cooled enough out of the oven that you can eat it without burning yourself"
* I think the very first one that made it to fruition was the thought of creosote in the rain cut off by the thought of cinnamon in sunlight, closely followed by the thought of cinnamon sugar coated almonds which led to fairs which got unexpectedly cut off by several Snow Crash quotes, the most repeated of which was "sweet-smelling, mauve-walled rooms and asked them questions about Ethics so perplexing"
