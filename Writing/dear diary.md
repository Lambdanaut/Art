Dear Diary,

another whole day spent incubating the egg...

It grew in size again. It's nearly the size of a football now.

At first I thought I was seeing things, but it's definitely growing fast, seemingly exponentially. When I had first discovered it, while rummaging through the discarded lumber pile, I thought for sure it was a chicken egg, despite its teal-blue hue. I immediately showed it to my wife, who figured it was a snake egg, based on the almost slimy translucency of the shell, but the recent growth rules out both of those options.

Another strange thing happened...

This morning when I reached out to touch it, I was shocked as if by static discharge.

I hope the baby is alright.

Let me know if you have any idea what kind of egg this is!

Well, that's my diary for today.

Me, Signing out!
