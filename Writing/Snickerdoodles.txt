Snickerdoodles are imaginary gods from Switzerland. They taste holy and chewy like my anus. Sometimes they rule Norway from Hell when Norweigans act "Norweigany". I believe Snickerdoodles will happily die for my sins in milk. Obey my Snickerdoodles that command my heart stomach. Chocolate rivers flow from heaven onto Switzerland. Please, Oh please, Pleasypleaseplease, visit our Switzerland. - Tourism
