[10:40:06 AM] Grandpa Josh: I had this dream where I was in a space station and there was this computer voice talking to me from the speakers

[10:42:30 AM] Grandpa Josh: I kept blacking out and entering rooms with tons of people that had little cute fat alien things attached to their heads that looked kinda like this, http://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/munna.jpg but more veiny and transparent and they didn't have the flower pattern. So like a disgusting one of those.
[10:42:36 AM] Grandpa Josh: and the people were blacked out and just floating there
[10:42:43 AM] Grandpa Josh: and the things were like parasites sucking on their heads
[10:43:27 AM] Grandpa Josh: and over time I learned that the AI that controlled the ship was doing this to them, and I tried to kill it.
[10:43:33 AM] Grandpa Josh: But right before I killed it, I blacked out a final time
[10:43:47 AM] Grandpa Josh: and then when I woke up, I realized that the computer didn't exist at all, and it was just a voice in my head
[10:43:49 AM] Grandpa Josh: and I was insane
[10:43:55 AM] Grandpa Josh: and I had put the parasites on everyone's head
[10:44:23 AM] Grandpa Josh: and I was swinging an axe at the computer's core right before I blacked out, but when I woke up the axe was plunged in my head, and I was bleeding out, and then I died
[10:44:25 AM] Grandpa Josh: and woke up irl
